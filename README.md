Note this codebase is not yet well documented and described, this will be done in the future!


Limitations of code:
- some csv have a , as delimiter others have ;
- amount of requirements and requirement names (e.g. R.SA.4.1) are hardcoded in code





Recreation:
1. make sure all transcripts are in `transcripts` folder
2. run `llm-call_retrieve-requirements.py`, check `progress.log` for any LLM calls that were not automatically fixed. This creates `single_results.csv` and `meta_results.csv` in `results` folder
3. run `verify_csv_content.py` to check for any issues in the csv files created. Check the python file for instructions on what FAILED means for a specific test
4. run `verify_quotes.py` to check failed quotes. Check this file for the conditions. Most likely some quotes fail. Check these in `single_results.csv` or `meta_results.csv`
5. run `llm-call_check-requirements.py`, again check `progress.log` for any failed LLM calls that were not succesfully retried
6. run `verify_human.py` and go through the on-screen steps in the GUI
7. open folder results. Move `analysis_meta_human.csv`, `analysis_single_human.csv` and `human_verification_state.json` into a folder inside `results` folde which you name _researcherx_ where the x is the number of the researcher. In our case 3 researchers conducted the human-in-the-loop intervention so we have `researcher1`, `researcher2` and `researcher3` folders
8. run `combine_human_assessments.py`
9. run `confusion_matrix.py`



# Human Verification Tool Setup Guide

## 1. Create a Python Virtual Environment

Python 3.13 is preferred but Python 3.11 or 3.12 may also work. Check your version:

`python --version`  
or  
`python3 --version`

Navigate to your project folder:

`cd path/to/your/project`

Create the virtual environment:

`python3.13 -m venv venv`

If Python 3.13 is not available, use:

`python3.12 -m venv venv`  
or  
`python3.11 -m venv venv`

On some Windows setups:

`py -3.13 -m venv venv`

## 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

Windows:  
`venv\Scripts\activate`

macOS:  
`source venv/bin/activate`

Visual Studio Code:  
1. Open the project folder in VS Code  
2. Open the terminal (View â†’ Terminal)  
3. Run the activation command for your system  
4. Select the interpreter from the venv folder if prompted

## 3. Install Dependencies

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 4. Run the Verification Script

Windows terminal:  
`python verify_human.py`  
or  
`py verify_human.py`

macOS terminal:  
`python3 verify_human.py`

Visual Studio Code:  
1. Open verify_human.py  
2. Make sure the correct interpreter is selected  
3. Press Run or F5

## 5. Using the Verification Interface

- Arrow keys to navigate between pages and items  
- y to mark an item as a match  
- n to mark an item as not a match

## 6. Output Files

The results folder contains:  
- human_verification_state.json which tracks the current state  
- analysis_meta_human.csv and analysis_single_human.csv which contain verification results

To start over delete:

`analysis_meta_human.csv`  
`analysis_single_human.csv`  
`human_verification_state.json`

Then run the script again.
