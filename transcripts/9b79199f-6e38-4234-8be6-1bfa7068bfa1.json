The resorts of this company provide services for their customers who come to the mountains for a skiing holiday. The services for the customers include room bookings at the resort hotel, ski equipment and clothing hire, and ski training classes.  The owner of the Cool Ski Resorts company is Mary/Jim Smith, and she has staff members in every resort to deal with accounts, customer service and inventory management. They also currently have a website with static contents to show the kind of services provided and contact information. The resorts are new and do not have a huge clientele. Mary/Jim wishes to increase the visibility of her/his resorts to a large number of customers. Therefore, she/he has decided to invest into an online system with reservation, booking, and payment options. Along with the website, she/he also likes to have a social media connection with the website. This will help in advertising on various platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.  Currently all the resorts have a simple system for all reservation and hire by telephone and fax and the payments are all handled semi-manually at the resort and are stored in a local database of each resort. She/he has assistants to manage the accounts and the taxation work for the businesses in each resort. The assistants also keep track of financial aspects regarding booking. The amount of coordination required among three resorts is mounting and Mary/Jim has decided to streamline the business in an innovative way.  Mary/Jim wishes to connect the online website with a centralized database of her/his business that keeps track of reservations, bookings, hires, and inventory in each resort. This will not only increase the revenue by exposing business to a larger customer community in the whole US, but also streamline the business and make it easier to generate reports. Mary/Jim is looking for innovative solutions that will help in competition with others. She/he wishes to restructure the whole business with digital solutions without too much disruption to her/his business as it is working now.  Mary/Jim has a vision for following potential features in her/his new website:  An aesthetically pleasing and intuitive website for customers to see what is available in each resort Online hotel reservation, hiring, and booking training classes Inventory management Promotion and advertisement through social media Query weather and snow condition forecasts for customers staying at the resort"
