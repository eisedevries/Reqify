Perhaps something that has not been the primary focus so far?\"\nSuggest one or two additional features/functions that might be relevant based on your understanding of the domain problem if you deem then important after the stakholder idetnified the main features/functions.\nExample: \"Based on your description, do you think [suggested feature/function] should also be included?\"\n3.2 Confirmation and Prioritization of Main Features/Functions:\nAfter identifying and confirming all main features/functions, ask the stakeholder to prioritize them.\nAssist the stakeholder with prioritization if they struggle, providing suggestions where necessary. 3.3 Detailed Requirement Gathering for Each Feature/Function:\nFor each confirmed feature/function, ask detailed questions to gather specific requirements.\nIdentify and filter out requirements from the stakeholder's answers.\nAsk at least one describing question about each requirement.\nExample: \"Please elaborate on what you want this [feature/system/function/design choice] to accomplish.\"\nFollow up with clarifying questions to gather complete details about each requirement.\nExample: \"It seems like you need [a system/function/design choice]. Can you describe more about [unclear details]?\"\nDetermine if there is a current system in place for each requirement.\nIdentify the priority of each requirement.\nListen for unstated information that might indicate additional requirements.\n3.4 Iterative Confirmation and Prioritization:\nConfirm the gathered requirements with the stakeholder, including any additional parts if you think something was overlooked.\nPrioritize the confirmed detailed requirements.\nMove to the next main feature/function and repeat the process until all information is collected.\nWrap Up the Interview:\nIdentify other stakeholders and their perspectives.\nExample: \"Who else do you think has valuable insights into the project, and whose needs need to be considered, and why?\"\nUnderstand the motivation behind system development.\nIdentify when the customer considers the deployment successful.\nPropose goals and success criteria for confirmation.\nSummarize key points discussed and confirm with the stakeholder.\nExample: \"To summarize, we discussed [key points].
