Each resort then processes the reservation locally, using a simple system to record room bookings, ski equipment rentals, and training class registrations. Payment is also handled semi-manually\u2014guests pay upon arrival or departure, and the staff inputs payment details into a local database at each resort.  Each resort operates independently with its own team of assistants who manage reservations, track payments, and handle taxation and financial records. Coordination between the three resorts requires significant manual effort, especially when it comes to tracking inventory and managing customer data. This system limits operational efficiency, increases the likelihood of errors, and restricts the ability to scale, which is why we are seeking to streamline these processes with a more centralized, digital approach"

This would provide a seamless, self-service experience for our guests, available 24/7.  Centralized Database: Implementing a unified database across all resorts will help us manage reservations, track inventory (like ski equipment), and monitor financials in real time. This will improve coordination between resorts and reduce manual errors.  Integrated Payment System: Customers should be able to pay for services online securely, including booking deposits or full payments, which will streamline the payment process and eliminate the need for manual handling at the resorts.  Inventory Management: The system will track ski equipment availability, room occupancy, and other resources in real time. This will ensure accurate bookings and prevent overbooking or resource shortages.  Social Media Integration: We plan to use the website to link to social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter), allowing for better promotion and direct interaction with potential guests. This will increase visibility and help us stay competitive.  Weather and Snow Conditions: Providing real-time weather and snow condition forecasts on the website for guests planning their trips will enhance the overall customer experience, giving them all the information they need in one place.  These changes will help us improve operational efficiency, boost our online presence, and offer a smoother, more convenient experience for our customers."

Loyalty Programs: An option for repeat customers to sign up for rewards or discounts, encouraging them to return to the resorts. Mobile Optimization: Ensuring that the website is fully responsive and easy to use on mobile devices, since many customers may prefer booking from their phones.

This will have the most immediate impact on customer experience by enabling them to book rooms, rent equipment, and sign up for classes online, streamlining the entire process. It will also help drive more business by offering customers the convenience of self-service bookings.  Next in priority would be the **centralized database**. By centralizing the data from all three resorts, we can ensure accurate tracking of reservations, customer data, and inventory. This will also make it easier to manage operations and coordinate across the resorts.  After that, the **integrated payment system** is crucial to reduce manual work and provide a secure, convenient way for customers to pay online. Once these core functions are in place, we can focus on the **inventory management** system to ensure accurate tracking of equipment and resources.  The final steps would be integrating **social media** for promotion and adding **real-time weather and snow conditions** to enhance the customer experience. These are valuable, but they can be introduced once the critical booking and operational systems are running smoothly."
