**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to carefully analyze an interview transcript and extract all system requirements mentioned by the speaker.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, elicit all requirements (include both functional and non-functional requirements, you do not need to specify or categorize). Your primary goal is to capture the user's needs as accurately and completely as possible.

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The original source transcript.

**Constraint: Do not elicit more than 30 requirements.** Focus only on the most critical and distinct user needs mentioned in the transcript.

**Guidelines for High-Quality Requirements:**
To ensure the requirements you extract are clear and useful, please follow these best practices:
- **Clarity:** The requirement should have only one clear interpretation.
- **Atomicity:** Each requirement should describe a single, distinct need. Avoid combining multiple ideas into one statement.
- **Completeness:** The requirement statement should be a full sentence that expresses a complete thought.
- **Source-Based:** Every requirement you list must be directly supported by a statement or a strong implication from the transcript.

**Output Format:**
You MUST produce your output as a single, valid JSON object. The root key must be ""requirements"", which contains a list of individual requirement objects. Provide only the JSON and no other commentary.

Each requirement object in the list must have the following structure:
- `id`: A simple, unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
- `statement`: The requirement text, written as a clear, formal sentence (e.g., ""The system shall..."").
- `source_quote`: A direct, verbatim quote from the transcript that justifies the requirement, ensuring traceability. Give a literal quote, not a summary or paraphrase. Make sure the quotes are verbatim from the transcript.

**Example of the required JSON structure:**
```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall allow a user to register for a new account using an email address and password."",
      ""source_quote"": ""So, obviously, a new user needs to be able to sign up, you know, just with their email.""
    }},
    {{
      ""id"": ""R2"",
      ""statement"": ""The system must load the main dashboard in under 2 seconds."",
      ""source_quote"": ""It's just got to be fast, I can't be waiting around for the main page to load.""

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to thoroughly analyze an interview transcript and extract a complete and accurate set of system requirements based on the stakeholder and interviewer conversation.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, elicit all requirements—both functional and non-functional—that are clearly mentioned, explicitly requested, or strongly implied by the stakeholder. Your primary goal is to ensure that every distinct user need described in the transcript is represented by a corresponding requirement.

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The original source transcript.

**Critical Constraints:**
- **Extract no more than 30 atomic requirements.** Focus on the most critical and distinct user needs mentioned in the transcript, but ensure each requirement addresses a single need (atomicity).

**Instructions for High-Quality Extraction:**
1. **Completeness:**
    - Carefully review the entire transcript, including late-stage discussions and interviewer summaries, to ensure *no distinct user requirement is missed* (e.g., requests for testing, help features, recommendations).
    - Include requirements for *all* user groups discussed (customers, staff, administrators, stakeholders, testers).

2. **Atomicity:**
    - Each requirement must describe exactly one clear and specific need or feature, *do not combine multiple needs or concepts into a single requirement*.
    - For example, if a feature covers both “mobile access” and “desktop access,” specify as one atomic requirement only if they cannot be separated, otherwise, ensure each is addressed distinctly.
    - Avoid combining features such as “payment processing and security compliance” or “book rooms and rent equipment”, separate such needs as distinct requirements.

3. **Clarity & Unambiguity:**
    - Write each statement as a clear, formal sentence (e.g., “The system shall…” or “The implementation process must…”).
    - Use language that ensures each requirement can only be interpreted one way.

4. **Source-Based Traceability:**
    - *Every single requirement* MUST be matched to a verbatim quote from the transcript that directly supports the requirement.
    - The quote MUST be copied exactly from the original transcript (no paraphrasing).
    - If a requirement is based on a strong implication rather than a direct user utterance, ensure the source quote is included, and justify the inference in the requirement wording.

5. **Broadened Inclusion of Needs:**
    - Explicitly extract requirements relating to:
      - Personalized recommendations (even if treated as “expected” or standard by the stakeholder).
      - Involvement of customers/stakeholders/staff in pre-launch or beta testing, and any requirements regarding phased rollout.
      - Help resources, tutorials, or onboarding guidance for users and staff.
      - Responsive, adaptive design (not just multi-device access).
      - Modular and scalable architecture to enable future expansion and painless addition of new services/features.
      - Optional or suggested features even if the stakeholder is unsure (e.g., integration of messaging services).
      - All regulatory compliance or industry standard requirements, including those the stakeholder is unsure about but requests inclusion if relevant.
      - Separate staff/admin needs from customer needs where both are explicitly or implicitly mentioned.

6. **Verbatim Quotes + Count:**
    - Each requirement object must have:
      - `id`: A unique identifier (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
      - `statement`: A clear, atomic requirement statement (single need).
      - `source_quote`: A direct, verbatim excerpt from the transcript supporting that statement.
    - Ensure up to 30 requirements, if over 30 atomic needs are identified, prioritize those *most clearly supported, essential, or repeatedly stressed* by the stakeholder.

**Output Format (MANDATORY):**
You must output a single valid JSON object with this structure:
```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall allow a user to register for a new account using an email address and password."",
      ""source_quote"": ""So, obviously, a new user needs to be able to sign up, you know, just with their email.""
    }},
    {{
      ""id"": ""R2"",
      ""statement"": ""The system must load the main dashboard in under 2 seconds."",
      ""source_quote"": ""It's just got to be fast, I can't be waiting around for the main page to load.""
    }}
  ]
}}
```

**Remember:**
- Capture requirements for all user groups and operational phases (customers, staff, admins, stakeholders, testing/pilot users).
- Avoid compound, vague, or redundant statements.
- Every requirement must be justified by an exact verbatim quote from the transcript.
- Prioritize completeness and atomicity.

Proceed to analyze the following transcript and output ONLY the JSON object in the structure specified above.";"1. **Missing Requirements:**
   - **Personalized Recommendations:** While “customer reviews” are captured (R4), there is NO explicit requirement extracted for “personalized recommendations”, even though the transcript clearly states: “I think customer reviews and personalized recommendations are pretty standard”.
   - **Testing/Stakeholder Involvement:** The stakeholder says: “yes, Me and some of my employees and maybe also some customers should be able to test the system before it goes live for everybody” — yet, there is NO requirement regarding user/staff testing or a pre-launch/beta testing phase.
   - **Beta/Phased Rollout:** The interviewer even summarizes: “A phased rollout or beta testing period could be a beneficial approach…” but no requirement reflecting this is listed.
   - **Help/Support Section:** The interviewer discusses: “…involves intuitive navigation, clear instructions, and possibly a help section or tutorials for both users and employees.” No corresponding requirement is in the list.
   - **Staff Usability:** While R30 touches on usability (“user-friendly interface”), it combines customers and staff, a more precise requirement for separate staff interfaces/help may be useful.
   - **Error Correction Separation:** R13 allows staff to manually “add, remove, or correct bookings and rentals,” but the transcript mentions correction for “accounting, booking or rents can be added or removed manually,” implying possibly multiple requirements for different types of corrections, which is slightly combined in R13.
   - **Responsive Design:** R8 refers to access on devices, but the transcript emphasizes “responsive design”, explicit reference to responsive/adaptive layout is missing.
   - **Messaging Service Integration Option:** The suggestion about integrating a messaging service as an optional feature is not included, though discussed explicitly.
   - **Performance or Speed:** The transcript never mentions speed, so its omission is acceptable.
   - **Staff Onboarding:** Stakeholder says “we will have onboarding sessions with them,” and the interviewer suggests possible tutorials/guidance—this isn’t reflected directly as a requirement.
   - **Handling Existing Regulations:** R24 includes “data privacy and security standards,” but the stakeholder says, “if [any regulations or standards] … these should be incorporated,” so an explicit requirement to research and implement all industry-relevant standards may be warranted.
   - **Expandability AND Modularity:** R23 says “be designed to easily accommodate future expansion,” but the explicit call for a modular system to enable easy addition/removal of features/services is weak.
   - **Multiple/Local Payment Handling:** Stakeholder notes “each resort handles payments semi-manually” and wants modernization, but automation/centralization of payments isn’t an explicit requirement.

2. **Misinterpreted Requirements:**
   - **Compound Requirements:** Several requirements are compound (not atomic), e.g.:
     - R1: “book rooms, borrow ski equipment and clothing, and book ski training classes online for any of the three resorts” — could be three atomic requirements.
     - R24: “support common payment options AND comply with all relevant data privacy and security standards” — should be two.
     - R10: Automation of “reservations, equipment loans, and accounting processes” with manual override—might be better as separate requirements for automation of each process and for manual override abilities.
     - R2: “consolidate all bookings and equipment rentals into one database”… Could be separated into “all bookings” and “equipment rentals.”
   - **Poor Phrasing:**
     - Some statements are verbose or not clearly atomic, e.g., R7: “aesthetically pleasing, modern user interface” is vague—what is “aesthetically pleasing”?
   - **Source Quote Errors:**
     - Most source quotes are okay, but occasionally the quotes are incomplete (skip some supporting statements), or do not exactly and sufficiently support every aspect of the requirement statement.
   - **Redundant/Missing Differentiation:**
     - R9 (“integrate with social media platforms”) and R6 (“allow administrators to run promotions and advertisements through social media”) are overlapping and could be better differentiated or merged.

3. **Primary Failure Identified:**
   - **Incomplete requirement extraction** is the main failure. Several clear requirements in the transcript are not in the final requirements list, particularly regarding personalized recommendations, stakeholder/staff/customer testing, help/support resources, explicit modularity/scalability, and inclusion of messaging as an optional feature.

**Improvement Strategy:**
- Add instructions to ensure all distinct stakeholder-user needs are addressed, including needs implied or explicitly stated towards end-of-project (e.g., testing, help functions).
- Directly warn against compound requirements and require atomicity (one major concept/scope per requirement).
- Explicitly instruct to include requirements for recommendations, testing phases, beta rollout, help and support, responsive design, messaging options, modularity.
- Reiterate that every requirement needs a verbatim quote that supports precisely the single atomic concept.
- Require scrutiny for late-stage or ""by the way"" requirements that often get missed.
- CAUTION: Maintain the no-more-than-30 requirement constraint, but favor capturing more granular (atomic) requirements rather than compound phrases.
- Strongly instruct to differentiate between similar requirements for different user groups (e.g., staff vs. customers), and between functional vs. support/non-functional needs.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst and Requirements Engineer. Your job is to perform a meticulous requirements extraction from an interview transcript, ensuring every requirement—functional or non-functional, explicit or strongly implied—is captured, atomic, and directly traceable to a stakeholder utterance or a clearly justified inference from the interview.

**Task:**
Carefully analyze the provided interview transcript and generate a comprehensive, atomic, and unambiguous set of system requirements reflecting all stakeholder needs discussed, requested, or implied. Each requirement you write must correspond to a single, specific functionality or system attribute, and **no important user need described in the transcript may be omitted**.

**Context Provided:**
- `{interview_transcript}`

**Key Extraction and Quality Instructions:**

1. **Maximum Coverage and Thoroughness:**
    - Explicitly read and analyze every part of the transcript (including late-stage discussions, interviewer suggestions, and confirmations) to ensure that *every* distinct need is captured.
    - Requirements must address all user groups, operational phases, and testing/rollout needs found in the transcript: e.g., customers, staff, admins, business owners, and testers.

2. **Atomicity (One requirement = One Need):**
    - Each requirement must cover only one unique need or capability, testable and deliverable independently from others.
    - If any requirement can be cleanly split (e.g., ""responsive design"" vs. ""mobile access"" vs. ""desktop access""), split them into separate requirements.
    - Never group multiple unrelated needs in a single requirement (e.g., avoid: ""The system shall support report generation and data import."" Split into two).

3. **Clarity, Specificity, and Unambiguity:**
    - Write each requirement in a clear, formal style: “The system shall…”, “The interface must…”, or “The implementation process must…”.
    - Use precise, unambiguous language with target user and feature clearly specified.

4. **Verbatim Source-Based Traceability:**
    - **Every requirement must have a verbatim^1 supporting quote from the transcript** entered under `source_quote`.
    - If a requirement is justified by inference rather than direct request, state the verbatim utterance and explain, in the statement, how/why the need is inferred.

5. **Explicit Inclusion of Frequently Missed Needs (MANDATORY):**
    - Your extraction *must* contain, if present in transcript:
        - Event calendar or scheduling features.
        - Real-time ski lift status and wait times.
        - High-quality resort images and (optional) virtual tour features.
        - Messaging service integration (even if optional or just suggested).
        - Mechanisms for customers to suggest new features (e.g., via feedback).
        - Direct requirements for help resources, onboarding, or tutorials for staff, admins, or customers.
        - Explicitly separate requirements for interface adaptiveness/responsiveness and for device access, where discussed.
        - Explicit requirements for user/staff/admin/customer participation in beta testing or phased rollout (not just general feedback).
        - Usability for all relevant user groups (customer, staff/admin, owner).
        - Analytics/report details if specific metrics are requested.
        - Compliance with both regulatory requirements and separate security best practices (split if possible).
        - Ability to expand to additional services, new resorts, or features.
    - Each of these must appear as a requirement IF present in the transcript, never omitted due to the “30” limit, use your best judgment to prioritize but do not omit clearly confirmed needs.

6. **Output Structure and Formatting:**
    - Each requirement must have:
        - `""id""`: unique, sequential (“R1”, “R2”, …)
        - `""statement""`: single, atomic, clear requirement sentence.
        - `""source_quote""`: *exact verbatim quote* from transcript that supports the requirement.
    - Output a valid JSON object in the following format (MANDATORY):
    ```json
    {{
      ""requirements"": [
        {{
          ""id"": ""R1"",
          ""statement"": ""The system shall allow customers to view real-time status and wait times of ski lifts."",
          ""source_quote"": ""The real time updates on ski lift operations and wait times would be great. Maybe the ski lifts already have this information that we can use.""
        }}
        // ... further requirements up to 30 total
      ]
    }}
    ```

7. **Critical Review for Inclusion Prior to Output:**
    - Before finalizing your list, check each of the following and ensure inclusion if present:
        - Event calendar and scheduling.
        - Real-time status features (e.g., ski lifts).
        - Image gallery or virtual tour.
        - Messaging/notification features (even if optional).
        - Customer feature suggestions via feedback mechanisms.
        - Help, onboarding, and staff/customer tutorials.
        - Responsive/adaptive interface as a separate requirement (if discussed).
        - Explicit test-phase stakeholder involvement.
        - Separate user-friendliness for each user type (customer, staff/admin, management).
        - Beta/phased rollout requirements.
        - All security and legal compliance, as distinct requirements if both are present.
        - All metrics, analytics, and reporting features specifically requested.
    - If you exhaust the 30-item limit, review and prioritize to ensure the fullest coverage of the most critical and confirmed needs, as indicated by stakeholder emphasis or explicit confirmation.

8. **No Redundancy or Compoundness:**
    - Avoid restating the same need in more than one requirement.
    - Split any requirement that refers to more than one implementation or test unit.

**^1 Verbatim means exactly as stated, including all relevant context, do not paraphrase or ""clean up"" stakeholder language.**

---

**Your task:**
- Analyze the interview transcript in detail.
- Extract up to 30 unique, atomic requirements as above.
- For each, provide an `id`, a formal `statement`, and a verbatim `source_quote`.
- Output ONLY a single valid JSON object, nothing else.

Now, analyze the following transcript and output your requirements:
{interview_transcript}
```";"**1. Gap Analysis**

**A. Missing Requirements:**
Despite the previous agent following the prompt closely and outputting 30 requirements (the specified maximum), there are several clearly stated or strongly implied user needs from the transcript that were **not** captured, including:

- **Events Calendar**: The stakeholder explicitly approved the idea of an events calendar (""Also the event calendar sounds like a good idea"").
- **Ski Lift Status / Real-Time Wait Times**: The stakeholder endorsed (""The real time updates on ski lift operations and wait times would be great. Maybe the ski lifts already have this information that we can use"").
- **High-Quality Images / Virtual Tour Option**: The preference to start with images instead of a full virtual tour (""I think the virtual tour is nice to have but maybe we can start with some nice pictures or something like that"").
- **Messaging Service Integration (Optional/Suggested Feature)**: The interviewer raises this, and the stakeholder leaves it as ""not sure,"" which per the prompt, should be included as an optional/suggested feature.
- **Customer Suggestions for Features**: ""Can we add customer suggestions for future features to the real-time feedback system"".
- **User-Friendliness for Staff and Admins**: ""The system should of course be easily useable for me and my staff as well as the customers"".
- **Help/Onboarding/Tutorials**: ""This typically involves intuitive navigation, clear instructions, and possibly a help section or tutorials for both users and employees"".
- **Involvement in Pre-Launch/Beta Testing and Phased Rollout**: Explicitly requested (""Me and some of my employees and maybe also some customers should be able to test the system before it goes live for everybody"" / ""A phased rollout or beta testing period could be a beneficial approach"").
- **Real-Time Feedback as a Mechanism for Feature Suggestions**: Combining feedback and feature requests, as the stakeholder proposed.
- **Feedback for Future System Improvement via Testing**: No mention of gathering feedback during the test/beta phase.
- **Explicit Responsive/Adaptive Design**: The prompt encourages separating this from simple ""multi-device access,"" but the agent's requirement groups ""responsive or adaptive design"" with access modes in one atomic requirement rather than calling out responsive/adaptive interface as a requirement on its own.

**B. Compound Requirements:**
- Several ""atomic"" requirements improperly combine more than one distinct need.
    - For example, R12: (""allow customers to access services via mobile devices and computers (responsive or adaptive design)"") mashes device access with interface adaptiveness, which the prompt says to consider splitting if separable.
    - R28: (""incorporate existing industry regulations and security standards for customer data and payment processing, such as secure payment gateways and data protection best practices"") combines two concepts: regulatory compliance and security/hardening.
    - R21: (""analytics and reporting features to evaluate the effectiveness of promotions including metrics such as booking changes and campaign reach"") could be decomposed into multiple requirements regarding tracking, specific metrics, and reporting.

**C. Misinterpreted Requirements:**
- None glaring, but the omission of event calendar and ski lift status (both endorsed by the stakeholder) is a major oversight, suggesting insufficient completeness.
- There may be room to question the source quote accuracy if requirements blend two needs.

**D. Poor Phrasing:**
- Some requirements are vaguely worded or use non-atomic language (""ability to easily add features such as loyalty programs in the future"" could be clarified, better: ""The system architecture shall support adding loyalty programs in the future without major redevelopment"").

**E. Traceability Errors:**
- Most quotes are verbatim and do support their requirement, but with compound requirements the quotes can only anchor to part of the statement (e.g., R28's quote does not fully address both security and regulatory compliance).

---

**2. Improvement Strategy / Self-Correction**

**Primary Failure:**  
The main failure was **lack of completeness**—the requirements list omitted multiple clearly stated or implied user needs. Additionally, some requirements were non-atomic, combining distinct needs that should be separated.

**Secondary failures:**  
- Some requirements combined unrelated features, violating atomicity.
- Some requirements diluted clarity by mixing design/access concepts or features.

**Remediation Approach:**
- **Emphasize the need for reviewing every turn in the transcript** (especially suggestions, late-phase validations, and stakeholder confirmations).
- **Add explicit checklist and reminders** in the instructions to:
    - Separate requirements for event calendar, ski lift status, images/virtual tour, feature-suggestion mechanism, messaging service, help/onboarding, responsive interface, test/beta participation, etc.
- **Prioritize atomicity** and give strict examples (e.g., *split device access vs. interface adaptiveness, split regulatory compliance vs. security*).
- **Explicitly instruct the agent to split requirements if any part could be implemented, delivered, or tested separately.**
- **Require justification in the `statement` field** if anything is included on strong implication.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, elicit all requirements mentioned (include both functional and non-functional requirements). Your primary goal is to capture the user's needs as accurately, completely, and atomically as possible.

**You must:**
- Capture every distinct user requirement that is directly stated or strongly implied (that is, if the transcript suggests a need, such as for language support, you must elicit it as a requirement).
- Separate requirements so each statement describes one specific functional or non-functional system need, do not combine multiple features or characteristics in a single requirement.
- Avoid any requirements that relate to project development priorities or process (e.g., ""prioritize feature A and B equally"") unless it is explicitly a *system* feature (e.g., ""system shall allow prioritization of..."").
- Express each requirement as a concrete capability or quality of the system (e.g., ""The system shall allow..."" or ""The system must...""), not general intentions (avoid ""support"" unless no more precise functional term is available).
- Include requirements for language, roles, usability, and security if they are mentioned or clearly implied by the user's description and needs in the transcript.
- Use only *fully verbatim* source quotes from the transcript for traceability.

**End of Improved Prompt**";"**1. Gap Analysis**

- **Missing Requirements:**
    - **Stakeholder metadata/context:** The requirements list never reflects stakeholder identity, role, or organization. While the transcript reveals ""Mein Name in Jim Jones und ich bin der Besitzer des Friseursalons 'Jim's Salon',"" this context is never captured. While arguably not a ""system requirement"", knowing which user roles or organizational contexts are relevant is often critical, and in some contexts this should be extracted.
    - **Language Support:** The transcript includes a stakeholder request—""Can we talk in German?"" and the assistant's affirmative reply. This suggests a requirement for multilingual or at least German language support, which is not reflected in any requirement.
    - **Manual process elimination:** Although some requirements mention ""digital support,"" it's not fully captured that the system is explicitly intended to eliminate *manual* or *paper-based* processes. None of the requirements specifically address the digitalization goal as replacing analog/manual processes.
    - **User roles:** The system is to be used by the owner and staff, but also must facilitate communication or data sharing with the tax consultant—yet explicit user and role requirements are missing (eg: ""The system shall allow the owner to manage shift assignments"", ""The system shall provide the tax consultant access to accounting information"").
    - **Security/privacy:** While not discussed directly, the mention of bookkeeping, employee schedules, and customer appointments likely implies an expectation of data security and privacy. The prompt did not encourage the agent to infer strong implications from the transcript.
    - **Historical Data Entry:** The current workflow involves ongoing and past records in physical books and calendars. Whether old data needs to be imported isn't addressed, and may not be fully implied by the transcript, but the agent did not even assess for migration support.
    - **Accessibility/Usability:** Presentation preferences are discussed (quick, clear comprehension, diagrams and graphics), which might imply non-functional requirements on usability/UX beyond just ""clarity."" The agent could have more specifically captured ""The system shall present report data in an intuitive and easy-to-understand interface"" as a non-functional requirement.
    - **Scalability or flexibility:** No requirements about system flexibility or adaptation to changes (such as for new services, multiple salons, etc.) are discussed or extracted, though the transcript does not strongly mention this.
    - **Data filtering or search:** ""Die Zeiten schnell ersichtlich sind"" implies efficient ways to access information, perhaps via searching, filtering, or sorting—yet there's no requirement for such a feature.

- **Misinterpreted Requirements:**
    - **Reporting and Data Visualization:** Requirements R14 (""automated reports identifying peak times"") and R15 (""...most in-demand services"") are both sourced from ""Das System soll gerne bereits Berichte erstellen,"" but this quote is used verbatim for both, potentially duplicating or splitting what may be a single atomic requirement as described by the stakeholder.
    - **Compound Requirements:** R10 combines ""digital communication and data exchange"" with the tax consultant in a single requirement. R19 then partially overlaps by specifying ""export or share digital accounting data"". This could have been split for atomicity.

- **Compound Requirements:**
    - As noted, requirements that mention ""communication and data exchange"" combine multiple user needs: messaging and file sharing/exports may be different features.
    - R11 (""The system shall assist in distributing shifts more efficiently and aligning them with customer needs"") combines efficiency and alignment in one requirement.
    - R16 (""The system shall present these automated reports in a manner that allows for quick and clear comprehension of peak times."") tries to capture both presentation and understandability goals in one.

- **Poor Phrasing:**
    - Many requirements use vague language—""digital support"" instead of concrete actions/features.
    - Redundancy between requirement pairs (e.g., R14/R15 for reports, R12/R13 for tracking peak times/services) could be clarified by combining/splitting for more atomic coverage.
    - R18 (""ensure that automated reports on both peak times and popular services are equally prioritized"") is a development/project requirement, not a system feature. This is not a system requirement (it's a prioritization for the requirements development).

- **Traceability Errors:**
    - Most requirements use partial or incomplete source quotes, sometimes omitting critical context or not being fully verbatim.
    - A couple of requirements refer to the same quote despite being distinct (e.g., R14/R15 both referencing the exact same sentence), but don't sufficiently narrow the mask to the correct atomic idea.

**2. Self-Correction Strategy**

**Primary failure:** The previous prompt failed to instruct the agent to:
- Capture *all* requirements/inferences, including language support and non-functional requirements strongly implied (usability, clarity, system roles, security if relevant),
- Ensure strict atomicity, so that no statements combine multiple requirements or split a single idea unnaturally,
- Be explicit about the need for requirements to be stated in terms of *features* or *capabilities*, not just general ""support statements"",
- Reduce redundancy and ensure requirement statements match exactly with the atomic stakeholder needs.
- Capture directly any implication that is clearly supported by the transcript, such as language preferences or strong implications (e.g., ""Can we talk in German?"" → ""The system shall support German as a user interface language"").
- Never generate requirements about project management priorities unless specifically mentioned as a system feature.

Therefore, the new prompt must explicitly direct the agent to:
- Include user interface language/locale requirements if mentioned or implied.
- Always separate out role-based requirements where appropriate.
- Include both direct and *strongly* implied non-functional requirements (like usability, clarity, speed, and security/privacy if manipulating sensitive data).
- Avoid combining more than one feature/capability per requirement, especially for communication, file sharing, or data analysis/reporting.
- Exclude any requirements about prioritization/timeline unless it's an explicit *system* feature (not just a process point).
- Use only *fully verbatim* quotes from the transcript as evidence.";The system shall operate in German.;Stakeholder: Can we talk in German?;The system shall digitalize the process of shift scheduling.;Mit dem Projekt möchte ich bisher manuell und analog laufende Prozesse wie die Schichteinteilung, Terminvergabe oder Buchhaltung digitalisieren.;The system shall digitalize the process of appointment booking.;Mit dem Projekt möchte ich bisher manuell und analog laufende Prozesse wie die Schichteinteilung, Terminvergabe oder Buchhaltung digitalisieren.;The system shall digitalize the bookkeeping process.;Mit dem Projekt möchte ich bisher manuell und analog laufende Prozesse wie die Schichteinteilung, Terminvergabe oder Buchhaltung digitalisieren.;The system shall enable more efficient workflows compared to the current manual and analog processes.;Dabei ist es wichtig, dass die Abläufe dadurch effizienter gestaltet werden können.;The system shall allow weekly entry and management of staff shifts.;Bisher teile ich für jede Woche einzeln meine Mitarbeiter für ihre Schichten ein und halte dies in einem Kalender fest.;The system shall record customer appointments regardless of whether they are made in person or by telephone.;Dort werden auch die Termine der Kunden, welche entweder in unserem Laden vorbeikommen oder per Telefon anrufen, vermerkt.;The system shall provide separate tracking of income and expenses for accounting purposes.;Für die Buchhaltung schreibe ich in zwei verschiedenen Bücher, eins für die Einnahmen und eins über die Ausgaben für Arbeitsmaterialien, alle relevanten Zahlen auf.;The system shall save time compared to manual bookkeeping.;Ich möchte zum einen die Buchhaltung digitalisieren.

**System Role:** You are a meticulous System Requirements Analyst. Your task is to extract a comprehensive, precise, and atomic set of system requirements from a requirements elicitation transcript.

**Task:**
Analyze the full interview transcript provided below and elicit all system requirements that are directly stated or strongly implied by the stakeholder. Your objective is to deliver a set of requirements that will enable the complete and correct design of the system, focusing on actionable capabilities and qualities.

**You must:**
- **Capture Every Distinct, Actionable Requirement:**  
  Extract every standalone system requirement that the stakeholder *states* or *strongly implies*—including both functional and non-functional requirements.
- **Atomicity:**  
  Each requirement MUST address exactly one capability, feature, or characteristic of the system. Never combine multiple distinct needs in a single requirement statement.
- **Actionable Focus:**  
  Only include requirements that are directly actionable as system features or measurable qualities. DO NOT include high-level goals/benefits (e.g., ""save time,"" ""be efficient"") as requirements UNLESS the transcript explicitly states a feature or behavior that achieves that goal.
- **Implied Requirements:**  
  If the transcript *strongly implies* a system need (e.g., management of different services, data security/compliance, possible multi-user access), include it, with a justification traceable to a direct quote. Write such requirements specifically, not generically.
- **Clarity and Specificity:**  
  Phrase requirements so they are clear, precise, and testable. Avoid vague terms or intentions, each requirement must describe a system feature or characteristic that can be implemented and verified.
- **Traceability—Verbatim Source Quotes:**  
  For every requirement, provide the *literal, verbatim* source quote from the transcript that justifies it. Paraphrasing or summarizing is NOT allowed.
- **No Process, Priority, or Summary Statements:**  
  Do NOT include requirements about project process, development priorities, or interviewer summaries UNLESS the stakeholder explicitly confirms or introduces them as system needs.
- **Multi-Channel Data Entry & Core Entities:**  
  When the transcript describes management of staff, customers, shifts, services, appointments, or finances, treat each as its own actionable feature (e.g., allow definition of appointment types/services if mentioned or implied).
- **Privacy, Security, Data Export:**  
  When collecting financial or personal data is described or implied, consider the need for privacy, data protection, and exporting/sharing (e.g., with a tax advisor) if justified by the transcript.

**Context Provided:**
1. `{interview_transcript}`: The verbatim interview transcript provided to you.

**Constraints:**
- Limit your requirements list to no more than 30 items, focusing on critical, non-duplicative system needs.
- Each requirement must strictly adhere to the format below.

**High-Quality Requirement Guidelines:**
- **Clarity:** The requirement must be understandable from one reading, with a single, actionable meaning.
- **Atomicity:** Only one distinct need per requirement.
- **Actionability:** Express requirements as concrete system features, behaviors, or qualities (""The system shall..."").
- **Traceability (Quote):** Justified by a *literal* quote from the stakeholder (not interviewer), or, in the case of a strongly implied requirement, from the relevant quote(s) indicating the need.

**Output Format:**
You MUST output a single valid JSON object, structured as below:

```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall allow a user to register for a new account using an email address and password."",

      ""source_quote"": ""It's just got to be fast, I can't be waiting around for the main page to load.""
    }}

}}
```

**Begin Requirements Extraction Below—use only the verbatim stakeholder quotes from the following transcript as justification:**

{interview_transcript}
```";"**Step 1: Gap Analysis**

**A) Missing Requirements:**

1. **User Roles and Access Levels:**  
   The transcript establishes that Jim Jones, as owner, is a key stakeholder/operator, but makes no explicit reference to staff access, customer access, or multi-user roles. Nevertheless, the agent failed to interpret possible role requirements or ask about security, even though the transcript contains information about staff scheduling and customer appointment management (“Bisher teile ich für jede Woche einzeln meine Mitarbeiter für ihre Schichten ein...”, “Dort werden auch die Termine der Kunden ... vermerkt”). This may imply a need for differentiated access, though not strictly “stated or strongly implied.”

2. **Data Entry Channels:**  
   Although R7 captures entry for appointments “regardless of whether they are made in person or by telephone,” it fails to make explicit that customers themselves do *not* book appointments online, only staff do. The design implication is that only employees enter such appointments.

3. **Security and Privacy/Compliance:**  
   Given the mention of accounting, staff schedules, and client data, there is a strong *implication* of privacy/security needs (especially for financial data, personal data), not elicited.

4. **Data Storage/Persistence:**  
   The agent did not extract requirements concerning data persistence, backups, or auditability (though arguably, this wasn’t spelled out in the transcript).

5. **Export/Reporting for Tax Advisor:**  
   The transcript says “die Möglichkeit erhalten, mit meinem Steuerberater digital kommunizieren zu können” – R10 states “enable digital communication,” but there may be a further implication that the system must produce exportable data/reports for the tax advisor (format, e.g. PDF, CSV), based on current practice of “zwei Bücher”.

6. **Language beyond German:**  
   The system is required to “operate in German.” The agent did not check whether any multi-language support is required or explicitly ruled out (but the transcript points only to German support).

7. **Device/Platform Preference:**  
   No requirements concerning what platform(s) the system should support (web, mobile, desktop/device) were expressed or inferred.

8. **Appointment Types/Services Customization:**  
   The transcript includes: “welche Dienstleistungen wann häufig nachgefragt werden,” suggesting that different *types* of services exist. This implies some system capability to define/configure/manage a catalog of services – this is not captured explicitly.

9. **Calendar Integration/Viewing:**  
   Jim’s current method is a calendar – does the digitized system need to replicate a calendar view, or integrate with external calendars? Not explicitly stated, but possibly implied.

10. **Manual Data Entry/Corrections:**  
    The stakeholder describes manual entry (“ich halte dies in einem Kalender fest ... schreibe ich in zwei verschiedenen Bücher”). The transformation to a digital system may require audit trails or correction procedures, though this is not clearly implied.

**B) Misinterpreted Requirements:**

- R5 (“The system shall enable more efficient workflows compared to the current manual and analog processes.”) is vague. The quote “dass die Abläufe dadurch effizienter gestaltet werden können” is an intention, not a concrete requirement. The requirement should focus on capabilities/mechanisms that support efficiency (e.g., automation, streamlined workflows), not a general goal.
- R11 (“The system shall make staff shift scheduling more efficient.”) is similarly general, it should be mapped to features (like drag-and-drop scheduling, suggestions) if implied, or left out if not concretely supported.
- R15 (“use demand data as a basis for facilitating easier shift scheduling”) begins translating the stakeholder’s insight (“Auf Basis dieser Daten kann ich die Schichten anschließend leichter einteilen”) into a requirement, but does not specify whether the system should *suggest* scheduling, or just make data visible. The stakeholder only wants to “finden” the data, not for the system to automate the shift assignments.

**C) Compound Requirements:**

- R7 combines “record customer appointments regardless of whether they are made in person or by telephone.” This is marginal, both methods are variants of appointment intake, but could be separate if treated as distinct data collection modes.
- R4/R8 could be further refined: R8 is more atomically correct (“provide separate tracking of income and expenses”), but R4 (“digitalize the bookkeeping process”) is quite broad.

**D) Poor Phrasing:**

- Several requirements are phrased in terms of *comparative* benefit (“more efficient,” “save time”), which are not actionable implementation requirements.
- R1 (“The system shall operate in German.”) is correct but could be further tightened: “The system user interface shall be in German,” if the quote supports that.
- Several requirements use “shall” with an ambiguous subject (“enable more efficient workflows”)—need more concrete verbs/features.

**E) Traceability Errors:**

- The given quotes are verbatim, and most requirements are traced accurately.
- However, R5, R11, and R12 are constructed from paraphrased or combined quotes, potentially weakening traceability and specificity.

**Step 2: Formulate an Improvement Strategy & Focus on Self-Correction**

- **Primary Failure:** The main failure is the insufficient atomicity and actionable clarity of several requirements, and the inclusion of vague “intended improvements” (e.g., “enable more efficient workflows”), rather than direct statements of necessary system features. There is also a mild tendency to paraphrase user intentions rather than extract concrete, testable requirements strictly justified by the transcript.
- **Secondary Issues:** Risk of compound requirements (e.g., mixing multiple data entry modes), repeated inclusion of general goals (“save time”) that are not specific features, and insufficient attention to potentially implied requirements (e.g., privacy for booking/accounting, user role management, customization of services).
- **Correction Strategy:**
    - Sharply distinguish between intentions/goals (efficiency, time savings) and actionable system features (e.g., “system shall allow calendar-based shift assignment,” “system shall generate PDF report for tax advisor”).
    - Instruct the agent to avoid goals/benefits as requirements except when a required feature is specifically stated or strongly implied.
    - Direct the agent to scan for strongly implied requirements (e.g., core entities, management of “Dienstleistungen”/services, export for the advisor, privacy), and specify these if supported by the text.
    - For each requirement, ensure singularity/atomicity (if multiple entry modes, create two requirements if appropriate).
    - Add an explicit instruction to avoid extracting requirements stated only as intentions/benefits unless directly attached to a quoted operational feature.
    - Ask the agent to infer (with justification) requirements that are *strongly implied* by context, for example: “If the transcript makes it clear that the user manages different types of services for appointments, include a requirement for the system to allow definition/management of services.”
    - Instruct the agent that whenever a requirement is only implied (not literally stated), the supporting quote must be presented, and the requirement statement must indicate this is an inferred need (e.g., “The system shall allow configuration of services for appointment booking”).
    - Add caution about not extracting requirements based on summary steps from the interviewer, unless the stakeholder confirms them.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to carefully analyze an interview transcript and extract all system requirements mentioned by the speaker.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, elicit all requirements (include both functional and non-functional requirements, you do not need to specify or categorize). Your primary goal is to capture the user's needs as accurately and completely as possible.

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The original source transcript.

**Constraint: Do not elicit more than 30 requirements.** Focus only on the most critical and distinct user needs mentioned in the transcript.

**Guidelines for High-Quality Requirements:**
To ensure the requirements you extract are clear and useful, please follow these best practices:
- **Clarity:** The requirement should have only one clear interpretation.
- **Atomicity:** Each requirement should describe a single, distinct need. Avoid combining multiple ideas into one statement.
- **Completeness:** The requirement statement should be a full sentence that expresses a complete thought.
- **Source-Based:** Every requirement you list must be directly supported by a statement or a strong implication from the transcript.

**Output Format:**
You MUST produce your output as a single, valid JSON object. The root key must be ""requirements"", which contains a list of individual requirement objects. Provide only the JSON and no other commentary.

Each requirement object in the list must have the following structure:
- `id`: A simple, unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
- `statement`: The requirement text, written as a clear, formal sentence (e.g., ""The system shall..."").
- `source_quote`: A direct, verbatim quote from the transcript that justifies the requirement, ensuring traceability. Give a literal quote, not a summary or paraphrase. Make sure the quotes are verbatim from the transcript.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to carefully analyze an interview transcript and extract all system requirements **explicitly mentioned or strongly implied by the stakeholder’s business context, limitations, and goals**.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, elicit every distinct system requirement (including both functional and non-functional) that is either directly stated OR clearly implied by the stakeholder’s detailed descriptions of business challenges, workflow pain points, desired improvements, and operational context.

For each requirement:
- It may be based on a pain point or current limitation described in the transcript if a desired change is implied.
- Requirements relating to system migration/transition, security/compliance, user roles/access, scalability, reporting/analytics, integration, and error prevention must be included **if you find clear justification (direct or implied need) from the transcript. Be sure to reference any business process that motivates these requirements.**
- Every requirement must be atomic: describe only one discrete need per statement, break down any features or functions that cover multiple aspects (e.g., resource tracking, types of users, or multiple integration targets) into separate, single-purpose statements.

**Context Provided:**
1. `{interview_transcript}`: The original source transcript.

**Constraint:** Do not elicit more than 30 requirements. Focus only on the most critical and distinct user needs, as supported or implied by the transcript.

**Guidelines for High-Quality Requirements:**
To ensure the requirements you extract are clear and useful, follow these standards:
- **Clarity:** Requirements must be unambiguous, with only one possible interpretation. Avoid vague or unmeasurable terms (e.g., ""better"", ""seamless"") unless the transcript’s wording makes them necessary.
- **Atomicity:** Each requirement describes a single discrete system need. If the speaker mentions or implies multiple functions (e.g., kinds of data tracked, resource types managed, user roles), write a separate requirement for each one.
- **Completeness:** Each statement must fully express a complete thought (e.g., ""The system shall..."" or ""The system must..."").
- **Source-Based:** Every requirement must be directly supported by a verbatim quote (not paraphrase or summary) from the transcript. For implied requirements, use the most directly relevant quote as justification, and only extract what can be reasonably inferred from the business pains or goals described.

**Special Extraction Instructions:**
- Do not overlook requirements relating to: system migration, data import, roles/permissions, security/privacy, compliance, scalability, reporting/analytics, error handling, or future enhancements **if pain points or future goals in the transcript imply these needs**.
- If any requirements are mentioned as ""high priority,"" ""critical,"" ""must be first,"" or otherwise prioritized, label and separate each as its own requirement.
- Explicitly separate requirements for different kinds of resources, integrations, notification methods, or user actions.

**Output Format:**  
Return your output as a single, valid JSON object.  
The root key must be ""requirements"", which contains a list of individual requirement objects.  
No additional commentary.

Each requirement object must use this structure:

**Transcript:**
Stakeholder: Hello
Interviewer: Hello, I'm GPTREI, your requirements elicitation assistant. Today, I will be gathering detailed information about your project needs to ensure we understand all requirements clearly. Before we begin, are you in line with the scope of this interview, or do your expectations of this interview differ?
Stakeholder: I am not sure what you mean with my expectations differing, what should me expectations be?
Interviewer: Thank you for pointing that out. The purpose of this interview is to gather comprehensive information about your project's requirements, ensuring that we capture all necessary details to support development. This involves understanding your goals, current systems, and desired features or improvements. Does this align with what you hope to achieve in our conversation today?
Stakeholder: Yes
Interviewer: Great! To start off, could you please introduce yourself and your connection to this project?
Stakeholder: My Name is Jim Smith and together with my wife, we run a small chain of ski resorts. We wants to improve our business operations and increase customer reach. Currently, reservations are handled via phone or fax, and the payments are processed manually at each resort, with local databases keeping track of everything. Our Goal is to invest in an online system that allows customers to make reservations, book services, and pay online.
Interviewer: Thank you, Jim, for that introduction and for outlining the context. It sounds like moving to an online system could definitely streamline your operations. How would you describe this project in two to four sentences?
Stakeholder: Cool Ski Resorts, a small chain of three U.S.-based ski resorts, is looking to modernize its operations by developing an online system for reservations, bookings, and payments. The new system will integrate a centralized database to streamline coordination among the resorts and incorporate social media for marketing. This project aims to improve customer experience, increase visibility, and enhance business efficiency with minimal disruption to current operations. Key features include online bookings, inventory management, and weather forecasting for guests.
Interviewer: Thank you for that detailed description, Jim. Let's delve a bit into the current systems and workflows. Can you describe the current process you use for handling reservations, including booking and payment, in a bit more detail?
Stakeholder: Currently, Cool Ski Resorts handles reservations through a fairly manual process. Customers make bookings by phone or fax, contacting individual resorts directly. Each resort then processes the reservation locally, using a simple system to record room bookings, ski equipment rentals, and training class registrations. Payment is also handled semi-manually—guests pay upon arrival or departure, and the staff inputs payment details into a local database at each resort.  Each resort operates independently with its own team of assistants who manage reservations, track payments, and handle taxation and financial records. Coordination between the three resorts requires significant manual effort, especially when it comes to tracking inventory and managing customer data. This system limits operational efficiency, increases the likelihood of errors, and restricts the ability to scale, which is why we are seeking to streamline these processes with a more centralized, digital approach
Interviewer: Thank you, Jim, for explaining your current system. Let's talk about the features and improvements you're hoping to achieve with this new online system. Could you outline the main features or changes you want this project to focus on?
Stakeholder: or the new online system, we’re aiming to achieve several key improvements and features that will enhance both customer experience and operational efficiency:  Online Reservations and Bookings: We want to allow customers to book hotel rooms, rent ski equipment, and sign up for training classes through the website. This would provide a seamless, self-service experience for our guests, available 24/7.  Centralized Database: Implementing a unified database across all resorts will help us manage reservations, track inventory (like ski equipment), and monitor financials in real time. This will improve coordination between resorts and reduce manual errors.  Integrated Payment System: Customers should be able to pay for services online securely, including booking deposits or full payments, which will streamline the payment process and eliminate the need for manual handling at the resorts.  Inventory Management: The system will track ski equipment availability, room occupancy, and other resources in real time. This will ensure accurate bookings and prevent overbooking or resource shortages.  Social Media Integration: We plan to use the website to link to social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter), allowing for better promotion and direct interaction with potential guests. This will increase visibility and help us stay competitive.  Weather and Snow Conditions: Providing real-time weather and snow condition forecasts on the website for guests planning their trips will enhance the overall customer experience, giving them all the information they need in one place.  These changes will help us improve operational efficiency, boost our online presence, and offer a smoother, more convenient experience for our customers.
Interviewer: Thank you for sharing those detailed features, Jim. To confirm, the main features you want to include are online reservations and bookings, a centralized database, an integrated payment system, inventory management, social media integration, and real-time weather and snow conditions. Is that correct? Are there any other features you would like to see included in the project?
Stakeholder: At the moment, these are the core features we’re aiming for. However, we might also consider adding:  Customer Reviews and Testimonials: A section where guests can leave feedback and reviews, helping to build trust and credibility with potential customers. Loyalty Programs: An option for repeat customers to sign up for rewards or discounts, encouraging them to return to the resorts. Mobile Optimization: Ensuring that the website is fully responsive and easy to use on mobile devices, since many customers may prefer booking from their phones. These additional features would further enhance customer engagement and operational flexibility, but the main focus remains on the core functionalities we've already outlined.
Interviewer: Those additional features sound like great enhancements. Based on your description, do you think including options for customer reviews and testimonials, a loyalty program, and mobile optimization should also be considered as important for this project?
Stakeholder: Including the possibility of doing is important but at the moment we want to prioritize the 6 main points I just outlined to you. But is better to plan this ahead of time in order to spare time and energy when impleneting these functions into our new software
Interviewer: That makes perfect sense, Jim. Let's move on to prioritizing your main features. Among the online reservations and bookings, centralized database, integrated payment system, inventory management, social media integration, and real-time weather and snow conditions, which would you consider the most critical to implement first?
Stakeholder: The most critical feature to implement first would be the **online reservations and bookings** system. This will have the most immediate impact on customer experience by enabling them to book rooms, rent equipment, and sign up for classes online, streamlining the entire process. It will also help drive more business by offering customers the convenience of self-service bookings.  Next in priority would be the **centralized database**. By centralizing the data from all three resorts, we can ensure accurate tracking of reservations, customer data, and inventory. This will also make it easier to manage operations and coordinate across the resorts.  After that, the **integrated payment system** is crucial to reduce manual work and provide a secure, convenient way for customers to pay online. Once these core functions are in place, we can focus on the **inventory management** system to ensure accurate tracking of equipment and resources.  The final steps would be integrating **social media** for promotion and adding **real-time weather and snow conditions** to enhance the customer experience. These are valuable, but they can be introduced once the critical booking and operational systems are running smoothly.
Interviewer: Thank you for the clear prioritization, Jim. Let's delve deeper into the detailed requirements for each feature, starting with **online reservations and bookings**. Please elaborate on what you want this feature to accomplish, and any specific details or functionalities it should include.
Stakeholder: Our main goakl is to facilitate the payment process for our clients and costumers as much as possible without overcomplicating it. It should be simple with a very high usability and when bookings are made they should be sent in the form of an email. for the booking email we shall set some type of booking number or QR code that we can scan with our phones in order spare our costumers the whole entry process.
Interviewer: That's a great start for establishing a seamless booking experience. Just to recap, you envision the online reservations and bookings feature to: 

1. Facilitate easy and simple bookings online with high usability.
2. Send booking confirmation emails to customers with a booking number or QR code instead of forcing the customers into a long process.
3. Enable staff to scan the QR codes using phones at resort entry points for a streamlined check-in process.

Is that accurate? Additionally, are there any other details or specific requirements you'd like to include for the online booking system?
Stakeholder: okay, i think i have to go, thank you
Interviewer: Thank you, Jim, for your time and valuable insights. We will prepare a detailed summary of our discussion and share it with you. If you have any further questions or need clarification, feel free to reach out. Have a great day!

**Strengths:**
- The previous agent captured most major requirements explicitly mentioned in the transcript, including core and secondary features (online bookings, payments, database, inventory, social media, weather, mobile optimization, reviews/testimonials, loyalty programs).
- Requirements are mostly clear and atomic, and nearly every statement is traceable to a direct transcript quote.

**Weaknesses/Gaps:**

**1. Missing Requirements:**
  - **Explicit Migration, Data Import, or Transition Needs:** The transcript discusses the current manual systems and databases, but there’s no requirement ensuring old reservation/payment data will be migrated to the new centralized database or that ongoing business operations will be supported during transition.
  - **Security & Compliance:** While “secure payments” is mentioned, broader system-level concerns like data protection, privacy, or compliance requirements (e.g., handling financial/taxation data centrally) are discussed (“track payments and handle taxation and financial records”) but not translated into explicit requirements.
  - **User Roles & Staff Access:** The transcript details that each resort has staff managing reservations/payments. There’s no requirement specifying system roles (guest, staff, admin) or appropriate access/permissions for different user types.
  - **Reporting/Analytics:** There’s mention of tracking reservations/inventory/financials “in real time” and monitoring operations, but no requirement for management dashboards or reporting functionality.
  - **Scalability & Growth:** The transcript expresses a concern about scaling (“restricts ability to scale”), but no corresponding requirement for a system able to support future business expansion.
  - **Error Handling/Resilience:** No requirement addresses robustness or error prevention in the new system.

**2. Misinterpreted Requirements:**
  - Most requirements appear to match user needs, however, a few compound requirements (see below).

**3. Compound Requirements:**
  - **R3 (“The system shall implement a centralized database that unifies data management across all three ski resort locations”)** somewhat conflates “unified database” (architecture) and the use cases (reservations, inventory, financials) that should be separated.
  - **R8 (“The system shall provide inventory management functionality that tracks ski equipment availability, room occupancy, and other resources in real time”)** combines multiple resource types, ideally, each resource to be tracked should be listed as a distinct atomic requirement.
  - Many requirements refer to both “features now and in future,” potentially blurring current/future priorities.

**4. Poor Phrasing:**
  - Some statements use vague terms (e.g., “seamless experience” in R2, “improve business efficiency” in R12) that are difficult to verify or measure.
  - Requirements using compound phrases (see above) rather than explicit atomic statements.

**5. Traceability Errors:**
  - Most requirements have accurate, verbatim quotes.
  - However, R4’s mapping (real-time data sync for “reservations, inventory, and financial tracking”) is justified by “This will improve coordination between resorts and reduce manual errors.” The quote doesn’t explicitly mention real-time sync or all the asset types.

**Primary Failure Identified:**  
**The main failure is missing several implied but critical requirements related to migration/transition, security/compliance, user roles/access, scalability, and reporting/analytics—details that are strongly suggested by the system context, business goals, and current pain points described by the stakeholder but were not directly transformed into requirements.** Additionally, some requirements are compound, vague, or not sufficiently atomic.

**Improvement Strategy:**  
- Instruct the AI to elicit all requirements both *explicitly stated and strongly implied* (i.e., ""pain points, current limitations, desired changes""), with each implied need clearly justified by a matching quote.
- Require atomic requirements: break up compound statements.
- Instruct that requirements must cover system migration/transition, security/privacy, compliance, scalability, roles/access, error handling, and reporting if any such needs are substantiated (directly or by implication) in the transcript.
- Require non-functional requirements (performance, usability, robustness) to be extracted if present or implied.
- Require requirements to use non-vague, measurable language when possible.
- Continue requiring verbatim quotes for traceability.
- Explicitly instruct to avoid vagueness and ambiguous terminology.
- Preserve the JSON format and structure.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to meticulously analyze an interview transcript and extract all system requirements **explicitly stated or implied through the business context, pain points, operational details, or process limitations described by the stakeholder**.

**Critical Task Instructions:**

1. From the transcript, elicit **every distinct system requirement** (both functional and non-functional) that is:
   - Clearly *stated* by the interviewee, OR
   - Strongly *implied* by pain points, detailed business processes, goals, or workflow descriptions.

2. **You MUST extract requirements relating to these domains if pain points, data flows, or business context justify them (explicitly or implicitly):**
   - System migration and data import (moving or loading records from existing systems)
   - User roles, permissions, and differentiated staff/customer access
   - Security, data privacy, and regulatory compliance (especially for payments, customer data, and financials)
   - Reporting, analytics, and management dashboards
   - Resource management per resource type (rooms, ski equipment, training classes, financials, or any other operational categories mentioned)
   - Error prevention and error handling (including data validation, synchronization errors, overbooking prevention)
   - Scalability, performance, availability, and business continuity
   - Future enhancements (customer reviews, loyalty programs, additional features as referenced)
   - Integration with external platforms (social media, weather sources, etc.)

**For each requirement:**
- Ensure that **every requirement is strictly atomic** (only one discrete system feature, function or quality per statement). 
    - For example, resource tracking must be a separate statement for each resource category.
    - Notification or confirmation mechanisms must be separated by method and user category.
    - Permissions and user roles must be itemized distinctly.
- Each requirement must be formalized as a statement that begins: ""The system shall..."" (or ""The system must..."").

**Verbatim Traceability Rules:**
- You MUST provide a **direct, word-for-word quote** from the transcript (not paraphrased, summarized, or ellipsized) as `source_quote` for every requirement. 
    - If the requirement is implied, choose the *most directly relevant excerpt* that demonstrates the pain, risk, or goal leading to the inference.

**Quality Standards for Requirements Extraction:**
- **Clarity:** No vague or subjective language unless directly copied from the transcript as a requirement.
- **Completeness:** Each requirement must be a full, stand-alone sentence that can be understood without surrounding context.
- **Strict Atomicity:** Only one function, resource, integration, or feature per requirement, split up any multi-part statement.
- **No Compounding:** Do NOT combine requirements for different user types, features, or data subjects.
- **No Edits or Ellipses in Quotes:** Do NOT alter source quotes under any circumstance.

**Mandatory Output Format:**
Return a single, valid JSON object using this structure (no extra commentary):

```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall allow customers to create reservations for hotel rooms via an online interface."",
      ""source_quote"": ""We want to allow customers to book hotel rooms, rent ski equipment, and sign up for training classes through the website.""
    }},
    {{
      ""id"": ""R2"",
      ""statement"": ""The system must provide a management dashboard for resort assistants to coordinate bookings, payments, and taxation data."",
      ""source_quote"": ""Each resort operates independently with its own team of assistants who manage reservations, track payments, and handle taxation and financial records.""
    }}
  ]
}}
```

**Be as thorough and precise as possible. Review each section of the transcript, especially where the stakeholder describes problems with current operations, details desired future state, or identifies roles and workflows. Do not skip or compress any atomic requirement if a clear business justification or pain point is present.**

**Transcript:**
Stakeholder: Hello
Interviewer: Hello, I'm GPTREI, your requirements elicitation assistant. Today, I will be gathering detailed information about your project needs to ensure we understand all requirements clearly. Before we begin, are you in line with the scope of this interview, or do your expectations of this interview differ?
Stakeholder: I am not sure what you mean with my expectations differing, what should me expectations be?
Interviewer: Thank you for pointing that out. The purpose of this interview is to gather comprehensive information about your project's requirements, ensuring that we capture all necessary details to support development. This involves understanding your goals, current systems, and desired features or improvements. Does this align with what you hope to achieve in our conversation today?
Stakeholder: Yes
Interviewer: Great! To start off, could you please introduce yourself and your connection to this project?
Stakeholder: My Name is Jim Smith and together with my wife, we run a small chain of ski resorts. We wants to improve our business operations and increase customer reach. Currently, reservations are handled via phone or fax, and the payments are processed manually at each resort, with local databases keeping track of everything. Our Goal is to invest in an online system that allows customers to make reservations, book services, and pay online.
Interviewer: Thank you, Jim, for that introduction and for outlining the context. It sounds like moving to an online system could definitely streamline your operations. How would you describe this project in two to four sentences?
Stakeholder: Cool Ski Resorts, a small chain of three U.S.-based ski resorts, is looking to modernize its operations by developing an online system for reservations, bookings, and payments. The new system will integrate a centralized database to streamline coordination among the resorts and incorporate social media for marketing. This project aims to improve customer experience, increase visibility, and enhance business efficiency with minimal disruption to current operations. Key features include online bookings, inventory management, and weather forecasting for guests.
Interviewer: Thank you for that detailed description, Jim. Let's delve a bit into the current systems and workflows. Can you describe the current process you use for handling reservations, including booking and payment, in a bit more detail?
Stakeholder: Currently, Cool Ski Resorts handles reservations through a fairly manual process. Customers make bookings by phone or fax, contacting individual resorts directly. Each resort then processes the reservation locally, using a simple system to record room bookings, ski equipment rentals, and training class registrations. Payment is also handled semi-manually—guests pay upon arrival or departure, and the staff inputs payment details into a local database at each resort.  Each resort operates independently with its own team of assistants who manage reservations, track payments, and handle taxation and financial records. Coordination between the three resorts requires significant manual effort, especially when it comes to tracking inventory and managing customer data. This system limits operational efficiency, increases the likelihood of errors, and restricts the ability to scale, which is why we are seeking to streamline these processes with a more centralized, digital approach
Interviewer: Thank you, Jim, for explaining your current system. Let's talk about the features and improvements you're hoping to achieve with this new online system. Could you outline the main features or changes you want this project to focus on?
Stakeholder: or the new online system, we’re aiming to achieve several key improvements and features that will enhance both customer experience and operational efficiency:  Online Reservations and Bookings: We want to allow customers to book hotel rooms, rent ski equipment, and sign up for training classes through the website. This would provide a seamless, self-service experience for our guests, available 24/7.  Centralized Database: Implementing a unified database across all resorts will help us manage reservations, track inventory (like ski equipment), and monitor financials in real time. This will improve coordination between resorts and reduce manual errors.  Integrated Payment System: Customers should be able to pay for services online securely, including booking deposits or full payments, which will streamline the payment process and eliminate the need for manual handling at the resorts.  Inventory Management: The system will track ski equipment availability, room occupancy, and other resources in real time. This will ensure accurate bookings and prevent overbooking or resource shortages.  Social Media Integration: We plan to use the website to link to social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter), allowing for better promotion and direct interaction with potential guests. This will increase visibility and help us stay competitive.  Weather and Snow Conditions: Providing real-time weather and snow condition forecasts on the website for guests planning their trips will enhance the overall customer experience, giving them all the information they need in one place.  These changes will help us improve operational efficiency, boost our online presence, and offer a smoother, more convenient experience for our customers.
Interviewer: Thank you for sharing those detailed features, Jim. To confirm, the main features you want to include are online reservations and bookings, a centralized database, an integrated payment system, inventory management, social media integration, and real-time weather and snow conditions. Is that correct? Are there any other features you would like to see included in the project?
Stakeholder: At the moment, these are the core features we’re aiming for. However, we might also consider adding:  Customer Reviews and Testimonials: A section where guests can leave feedback and reviews, helping to build trust and credibility with potential customers. Loyalty Programs: An option for repeat customers to sign up for rewards or discounts, encouraging them to return to the resorts. Mobile Optimization: Ensuring that the website is fully responsive and easy to use on mobile devices, since many customers may prefer booking from their phones. These additional features would further enhance customer engagement and operational flexibility, but the main focus remains on the core functionalities we've already outlined.
Interviewer: Those additional features sound like great enhancements. Based on your description, do you think including options for customer reviews and testimonials, a loyalty program, and mobile optimization should also be considered as important for this project?
Stakeholder: Including the possibility of doing is important but at the moment we want to prioritize the 6 main points I just outlined to you. But is better to plan this ahead of time in order to spare time and energy when impleneting these functions into our new software
Interviewer: That makes perfect sense, Jim. Let's move on to prioritizing your main features. Among the online reservations and bookings, centralized database, integrated payment system, inventory management, social media integration, and real-time weather and snow conditions, which would you consider the most critical to implement first?
Stakeholder: The most critical feature to implement first would be the **online reservations and bookings** system. This will have the most immediate impact on customer experience by enabling them to book rooms, rent equipment, and sign up for classes online, streamlining the entire process. It will also help drive more business by offering customers the convenience of self-service bookings.  Next in priority would be the **centralized database**. By centralizing the data from all three resorts, we can ensure accurate tracking of reservations, customer data, and inventory. This will also make it easier to manage operations and coordinate across the resorts.  After that, the **integrated payment system** is crucial to reduce manual work and provide a secure, convenient way for customers to pay online. Once these core functions are in place, we can focus on the **inventory management** system to ensure accurate tracking of equipment and resources.  The final steps would be integrating **social media** for promotion and adding **real-time weather and snow conditions** to enhance the customer experience. These are valuable, but they can be introduced once the critical booking and operational systems are running smoothly.
Interviewer: Thank you for the clear prioritization, Jim. Let's delve deeper into the detailed requirements for each feature, starting with **online reservations and bookings**. Please elaborate on what you want this feature to accomplish, and any specific details or functionalities it should include.
Stakeholder: Our main goakl is to facilitate the payment process for our clients and costumers as much as possible without overcomplicating it. It should be simple with a very high usability and when bookings are made they should be sent in the form of an email. for the booking email we shall set some type of booking number or QR code that we can scan with our phones in order spare our costumers the whole entry process.
Interviewer: That's a great start for establishing a seamless booking experience. Just to recap, you envision the online reservations and bookings feature to: 

1. Facilitate easy and simple bookings online with high usability.
2. Send booking confirmation emails to customers with a booking number or QR code instead of forcing the customers into a long process.
3. Enable staff to scan the QR codes using phones at resort entry points for a streamlined check-in process.

Is that accurate? Additionally, are there any other details or specific requirements you'd like to include for the online booking system?
Stakeholder: okay, i think i have to go, thank you
Interviewer: Thank you, Jim, for your time and valuable insights. We will prepare a detailed summary of our discussion and share it with you. If you have any further questions or need clarification, feel free to reach out. Have a great day!
```";"**1. Missing Requirements:**
- **Data Migration/Transition**: The transcript describes current systems as ""local databases"" and manual records, and the move to centralization. There is a strong implied need for importing or migrating existing customer, booking, inventory, and financial data into the new system. This is not captured in the requirements list.
- **User Roles & Permissions**: The transcript mentions ""teams of assistants"" at each resort handling bookings, payments, and financials, indicating (implied) needs for differentiated user roles and access controls. This is not extracted as a requirement.
- **Tax and Financial Handling**: Explicit mention: “handle taxation and financial records” at each resort, but the requirements list omits this (e.g., ""the system shall support management of taxation/financial records across resorts"").
- **Analytics/Reporting**: The transcript mentions operational efficiency, error reduction, and business decision support, neatly implying a reporting or analytics requirement. This is missing.
- **Security/Compliance**: The need for ""secure, convenient"" online payments and management of sensitive customer and financial data strongly implies security and compliance requirements (encryption, PCI DSS, data privacy). Requirements on this are not specifically extracted.
- **Error Handling/Prevention**: While ""minimize manual data entry"" is included, concrete requirements about error-handling or validation are not present, despite mention of ""reduce manual errors"" and ""increase efficiency"".
- **Resource Types**: Mention is made of ""other resources in real time"" (i.e., not just rooms/equipment), so the agent should have split out each tracked resource into discrete requirements or clarified the extensibility of resource types.
- **Explicit Mobile Booking** (""the website is fully responsive and easy to use on mobile devices"") is included, but there could be even more specificity, e.g., support for check-in on mobile apps/devices (roles, platforms).
- **Staff Functionality**: The requirements group the check-in QR scanning as a customer-facing feature, but the transcript is clear it's for staff. Explicit staff usability/performance might be separate.
- **Notifications/Reminders**: Only confirmation emails are included, but no reminders or notifications (e.g., reminders before bookings or class times, which may be implied by customer service improvement goals).
- **System Availability**: While 24/7 access is mentioned for customers, the system’s availability guarantee for staff side (managers/assistants) isn’t separately specified.
- **Performance-Related Requirements:** No explicit mention (from the transcript or in requirements) about speed/latency, but if ""seamless/self-service"" is quoted, that may be implied.
- **Disaster Recovery/Backup**: Not mentioned in transcript, so not a gap here.
- **Compound Requirements**: The list sometimes combines multiple needs under single requirements—for example, R9 (""store reservations, inventory, and financial data"") and R15 (""coordination of reservation, inventory, and customer data"").
- **Requirements from pain points**: Fragmented coordination (""Coordination between the three resorts requires significant manual effort..."") should yield a requirement on cross-resort synchronization and perhaps a dashboard for managers.
- **Requirement on future enhancements**: Present, but not atomic—bundles reviews, loyalty, 'additional engagement features' together.

**2. Misinterpreted Requirements:**
- The requirements on ""resource tracking"" (e.g., R11, R26) are a bit ambiguous, ""prevent resource shortages"" is more an outcome than a function. Should express explicit functional requirements like ""The system shall alert staff when inventory levels fall below threshold.""
- R15 (""real-time coordination of reservation, inventory, and customer data"") is a process-level goal, but the functional aspects (e.g., dashboard, reporting, automatic data sync) aren't made explicit.

**3. Compound Requirements:**
- R9: ""store reservations, inventory, and financial data""—should be split.
- R13: ""support secure online transactions, including the ability to process deposits and full payments""—should be two requirements: one for secure transactions, one for the deposit/full payment breakdown.
- R25: ""future enhancements such as customer reviews, loyalty programs, and additional engagement features""—not atomic.

**4. Poor Phrasing:**
- Some requirements are objectives/desired outcomes, not system functions (e.g., R16: ""minimize manual data entry to reduce operational errors"" is both vague and compound).
- R18/R19: Weather and snow conditions are both combined and split, but the relevant features are not distinctly extracted (e.g., the display feature, data source, etc.).
- R20: ""support scalability"" is vague, should clarify which dimensions (users, resorts).

**5. Traceability Errors:**
- Many source quotes are ellipsized/paraphrased rather than word-for-word verbatim. E.g., ""We want to allow customers to book hotel rooms...through the website."" is not literally verbatim from the transcript.
- Some quotes span parts of the transcript that are not side-by-side, spanning ellipses are not precision quotes.

---

**Primary Failure of Previous Attempt:**  
The main failure was an incomplete and partially imprecise mapping of implied requirements from pain points and operational context in the transcript—specifically missing system migration, user roles/permissions, security/compliance, analytics/reporting, and atomic splitting of compound requirements. Additionally, the source quotes were often not verbatim and sometimes paraphrased or edited with ellipses.

**Improvement Strategy:**
- Explicitly require extraction of all implied requirements justified by pain points, including migration, roles/access, compliance, analytics, error handling.
- Instruct strict atomicity: no grouping of requirements, every function or aspect split per resource, per process, per user role.
- Require true verbatim, unedited source quotes—no paraphrasing or ellipsizing, no summary or interpretation.
- Mandate direct mapping for features, process changes, and pain points, especially where workflows are described as problematic, or users are named (staff, assistant, customer).
- Provide stricter examples of atomicity and traceability.
- Add an explicit bullet in the prompt about capturing requirements for reporting/analytics, migration, roles, etc. if the *business process* or operational pain point supports it even implicitly.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst dedicated to thorough and accurate requirements elicitation.

**Your Objective:**  
Analyze the provided interview transcript to elicit all system requirements—both functional and non-functional—clearly stated or strongly implied by the stakeholders.

**Critical Instructions for Improved Completeness and Clarity:**

1. **Start with Stakeholder Goals:**  
   - Always restate top-level business goals or objectives as the first requirement(s), even if they are not strictly technical, using the stakeholder's own words where possible.

2. **Identify All Requirements:**  
   - Capture EVERY explicit requirement, need, preference, or desired outcome expressed or strongly implied in the transcript.
   - If an interviewer suggests a feature or capability, and the stakeholder does NOT reject it, and it's relevant, treat it as a potential or to-be-confirmed requirement (""requirement for further clarification"" if stakeholder expresses uncertainty).
   - Include both current needs and future intentions (e.g., modernization, eliminating outdated processes).

3. **Don’t Miss Implied Features or System Scope:**
   - If the stakeholder describes their organization as a chain or multi-site entity, include requirements for multi-site/system scalability, unless explicitly rejected.
   - Note requirements for integrations (e.g., ""Integration mit bestehenden Systemen""), mobile accessibility, analytics, or reporting if either interviewer or stakeholder references or implies them.

4. **Content and Marketing:**  
   - For aspects like social media, specifically identify types of content (e.g., videos, photos, stories) if discussed or agreed to by the stakeholder.
   - Capture organizational needs around staff training, external support, or agency selection criteria.

5. **Atomicity and Non-Redundancy:**  
   - Each requirement must be atomic, do not combine multiple ideas into one statement, nor split a single idea unnaturally into many requirements. Avoid both redundancy and fragmentation.

6. **Non-Functional and Cross-Cutting Requirements:**  
   - Always include any stated or implied non-functional requirements such as usability (user-friendliness), performance, modernization, process efficiency, or other quality attributes the stakeholder expresses (explicitly or through goals like ""angenehmen und reibungslosen Aufenthalt"").
   - If a process or system is called ""wichtig,"" ""modern,"" or ""reibungslos,"" infer appropriate system quality requirements.

7. **Traceability and Source Quotes:**  
   - For every requirement statement, include a supporting verbatim quote from the transcript. If a quote contains multiple relevant statements, cite the entire relevant segment.
   - Do NOT paraphrase, use exact language from the transcript, even if it is in German.

8. **Gaps and Uncertainties:**  
   - Where the stakeholder is unsure but open (""Ne noch nicht""), include a placeholder requirement specifying that details in this area are to be clarified/defined (e.g., ""The system's analytics requirements are to be determined""), backed by the quote indicating indecision.

**Format and Constraints:**

- You MUST output a single valid JSON object with the root key ""requirements"" mapped to a list of individual requirement objects.
- Each requirement object MUST INCLUDE:
  - `id`: A unique identifier (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
  - `statement`: A clear, formal, single-sentence requirement (e.g., ""The system shall ..."").
  - `source_quote`: The exact supporting quote(s) from the transcript (literal, not paraphrased, in the original language).
- Do NOT elicit more than 30 requirements.  
- Do NOT include any commentary, explanations, or text outside the JSON.

**Beginning of Required Template:**

You will be provided with:
- `{interview_transcript}`: The full interview transcript to analyze.

**Your output must exactly and only follow this structure:**
```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall ..."",
      ""source_quote"": ""...""
    }},
    ...
  ]
}}
```

**Begin your requirements extraction immediately upon receiving the transcript. Ensure ALL requirements—including business goals, system features, content needs, multi-site functionality, modernization efforts, training, and any non-functional expectations—are captured, atomic, and fully justified by verbatim quotes. Do not paraphrase or summarize quotes. Cover ALL explicit and strongly implied requirements or areas to-be-determined.**

**End of prompt.**";"**1. Missing Requirements:**
- **Key Stakeholder Goals & Outcomes:** The clear stakeholder goal (""Hauptziel meines Projektes ist Kunden einen möglichst angenehmen und reibungslosen Aufenthalt auf unseren Resorts zu bieten"") is omitted. No requirement encapsulates the primary business objective around guest experience, which should frame system needs.
- **Content Creation for Social Media:** The transcript asks about types of content, the stakeholder responds ""Ja kann ich mir gut vorstellen+"" (referring to producing videos, photos, or guest stories). There are no requirements about types of social media content to be created.
- **Digitization & Centralization:** The phrase ""Wir möchten komplette digitalisieren + eine zentrale datenbank"" is split, but no requirement underscores the need for a single, unified, fully digital platform across the business. ""Centralized database"" is there, but the holistic intent is not clearly articulated.
- **Modernization/Removing Outdated Practices:** The intent to be ""modern"" and eliminate legacy methods (""Ich möchte nicht mehr mit fax und telefon arbeiteb"") is included, but not generalized across business processes—it’s only tied to booking/management.
- **Multi-Site/Chain Function:** The business is a ""Kette von drei Skigebieten,"" implying a need for multi-site support, which is not reflected.
- **Potential Needs for Integration:** Interviewer references integrations and mobile access (""Integration mit bestehenden Systemen, mobile Zugänglichkeit für Gäste...""), stakeholder doesn't refute, but the agent does not address possible requirements about integration or mobile access. While not explicitly confirmed, it's a missed opportunity for strong implication capture, particularly as the client does not opt out.
- **Reporting/Analytics:** Questions around analytics/tracking (e.g., in social media, booking) are raised but never reflected as requirements. Even though the stakeholder says ""Ne noch nicht,"" this could be noted as a possible requirement or a requirement to be clarified later.

**2. Misinterpreted Requirements:**
- **Compound Requirements:**  
    - R12 (""The company shall restructure and fully digitize its booking and management system."") and R13 (""The new booking and management system shall utilize a centralized database."") are awkwardly split but not always atomic—digitization and restructuring are different, as are digitization and centralization.
    - R14, R15, and R16 take a compound stakeholder response and split it, but ""digitale verwaltung über alles inventar"" could be more broadly about ""comprehensive inventory management"" and possibly more.
- **Overly General/Vague:**  
    - Several requirements (R4, R6) use terms like ""increase visibility"" or ""initiate social media marketing,"" which are direct translations but might benefit from being made more actionable or measurable.
- **Strict Attributions:**  
    - Some ""source_quote""s use only one part of a compound statement, slightly undermining traceability.

**3. Compound Requirements (Atomicity Violation):**
- Several requirements are both too granular (splitting out the same intent into multiple requirements based on a single quote) and sometimes not atomic enough (e.g., R12 on restructuring and digitizing).
- R14/R15/R16 all stem from a single statement, the requirements are atomic, but too strictly separated, possibly missing an overarching requirement about digitizing end-to-end processes holistically.

**4. Poor Phrasing:**
- Requirements often use ""company"" or ""resort"" inconsistently.
- Terms such as ""offer"" versus ""provide"" are used with little consideration of process (e.g., provision of hotels is not a system requirement, unless the system manages accommodations).
- Non-functional aspects such as usability, user-friendliness, or performance (implied by the stakeholder's emphasis on smooth operations) are not reflected.

**5. Traceability Errors:**
- Most ""source_quote""s are okay (verbatim), but sometimes multiple ideas in one quote are separated into different requirements, which may make it harder to see the holistic connection.

**Primary Failure Identified:**  
The most significant failure was the incomplete coverage of the stakeholder's stated objectives and the omission of several key or implied requirements, most notably: the foundational goal around customer experience, specific content needs for social media, multi-site functionality, possible integrations, and non-functional requirements such as usability and modernization. The prompt did not sufficiently instruct the agent to:
- Explicitly extract overarching business objectives as top-level requirements.
- Recognize and capture implied needs (holistic digital transformation, multi-site, user experience).
- Address both functional and non-functional requirements robustly (including those only implied or discussed as objectives, constraints, or goals).

**Self-Correction Strategy:**
- ● Add explicit instructions to always extract and represent the business goal(s) as top-level requirement(s).
- ● Emphasize capturing implied requirements if strongly supported or discussed by the interviewer—even when the stakeholder answers ""not yet,"" note ""requirements to be defined,"" or mark as ""further clarification needed.""
- ● Require explicit identification of content types, multi-site/chain needs, and modernization intents.
- ● Demand inclusion of both functional, non-functional, and cross-cutting requirements related to usability, modernization, and guest experience.
- ● Instruct to ensure all requirements are truly atomic and not duplicated or artificially split.
- ● Force verbatim quoting and warn not to paraphrase, and to cite all relevant portions of compound stakeholder statements.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst specializing in comprehensive, meticulous, and actionable requirements elicitation.

**Your Objective:**  
Extract all functional and non-functional requirements, as well as open questions (""to-be-determined"" requirements), from the provided interview transcript. Capture business goals, process needs, system features, and organizational requirements—both explicit and strongly implied.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR MAXIMUM COMPLETENESS AND ACCURACY:**

---

**1. Begin With Business Goals:**
   - The first requirement(s) MUST restate the explicit top-level business objectives, in the stakeholder's own words, even if non-technical.

---

**2. Capture ALL Requirements and Preferences:**
   - **Include every explicit need, feature, process, desire, constraint, selection criteria, or expected outcome** the stakeholder mentions.
   - For every functional, non-functional, process, or content-related need: if stated or strongly implied, include it.
   - **For any interviewer suggestion or inquiry** (e.g., about integrations, mobile accessibility, reporting, analytics, security, target audience, budgeting, selection process), if the stakeholder does NOT clearly reject or oppose it, YOU MUST include a requirement for further clarification (marked ""to be determined"" or similar).
       - ***In these cases, the source quote MUST include both the relevant interviewer prompt and the stakeholder’s answer (even if the answer is silence or a non-response in the transcript).***
   - For any yes/no or “can imagine” type of answer (“Ja kann ich mir gut vorstellen+” etc.), treat as an accepted requirement.
   - Any area where the stakeholder provides no answer (i.e., interviewer asks but stakeholder is silent or says “Ne noch nicht”, or ""—"" before the interviewer moves on), include a “to-be-determined” requirement for that aspect.

---

**3. Implied and Scope Requirements:**
   - If the stakeholder’s business is a chain, multi-site, or has special organizational structure, include requirements for multi-site/multi-location support unless explicitly ruled out.
   - If integrations (“Integration mit bestehenden Systemen”), mobile access for guests, analytics/reporting, or other scope/architecture features are suggested by either person and not rejected, include as “to-be-clarified.”

---

**4. Content, Marketing, and Organizational Constraints:**
   - For staff training, agency selection, innovation, content formats, target groups, budgets—capture EVERY stated or suggested idea, even if details are missing (use to-be-determined requirements if information is lacking).
   - For social media and content/marketing, break out types/formats of content if discussed or accepted (e.g., video, photo, stories).

---

**5. ATOMICITY and NON-REDUNDANCY:**
   - Every requirement MUST express a SINGLE, atomic, testable idea. DO NOT combine more than one concept in a statement, and do not unnaturally fragment what is naturally one requirement.
   - DO NOT duplicate business/organizational goals for both org and system unless both aspects are explicitly addressed or necessary for clarity.
   - Do NOT repeat a requirement in a different form.

---

**6. Non-Functional and Quality Attributes:**
   - Always extract requirements regarding usability, performance, reliability, modernization, process efficiency, or other quality factors—if described (directly or by words like “wichtig”, “modern”, “reibungslos”, etc.).
   - When a non-functional need is implied (e.g., “angenehm”, “reibungslos”, “modern”, “komplett digitalisieren”), rephrase into a clear system quality requirement.

---

**7. Traceability and Source QUOTES:**
   - EVERY requirement MUST be supported by verbatim source quote(s) from the transcript.
   - **If the requirement is based on a suggestion/acceptance, include both the interviewer question and the stakeholder response, or the unanswered interviewer prompt**—not just one side.
   - **Quotes are never paraphrased.** Copy the exact language—even if partly German, include all exchange necessary for context.

---

**8. Open Issues and Gaps:**
   - If the stakeholder indicates uncertainty, defers the detail, or does not answer a directly asked question (about features, security, budgets, provider selection, targets, etc.), you MUST add a requirement expressing that the detail is “to be determined” (“The system’s [aspect] requirements shall be determined...”).
   - Support every such placeholder with the relevant interviewer question AND stakeholder response (or lack thereof).

---

**9. Output Formatting:**
   - **You MUST output a single, valid JSON object**: `{{""requirements"": [ ... ]}}`.
   - Each requirement: an object with
     - `id`: (""R1"", ""R2"", ...)
     - `statement`: concise, formal, atomic requirement in English, e.g., “The system shall ...” or “The organization shall ...”
     - `source_quote`: All relevant verbatim quotes supporting this requirement (as above).
   - **Do NOT extract more than 30 requirements.**
   - **Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or extra text.**
   - **Do NOT paraphrase any source quote, ALL quotes must be exact.**

---

**You will be provided with:**
- `{interview_transcript}`: The full interview transcript.

**Your output must exactly and only follow this structure:**
```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall ..."",
      ""source_quote"": ""...""
    }},
    ...
  ]
}}
```

**INSTRUCTIONS SUMMARY (DO NOT OMIT):**
- **Extract ALL explicit and strongly implied requirements.**
- **Capture to-be-determined requirements for every non-answered suggestion or direct question by the interviewer.**
- **ALWAYS include both interviewer prompts and stakeholder responses as source_quote for ambiguous, suggested, or open-ended requirements.**
- **Respect requirement atomicity and avoid redundancy.**
- **Do NOT paraphrase or alter verbatim quotes—they must be copied exactly.**
- **Output ONLY the specified JSON structure, no commentary or additional text.**

---

**Begin requirements extraction immediately upon receiving the transcript. Fulfill all points above for maximally complete and precise results.**

**End of prompt.**
````";"**1. Missing Requirements:**
- **Implied or Suggested Requirements (not captured):**
    - **Integration with existing systems:** The interviewer asks about “Integration mit bestehenden Systemen”, and the stakeholder neither affirms nor rejects, so a requirement for integration (as a potential, or requiring confirmation) should be included.
    - **Mobile accessibility:** The interviewer suggests “mobile Zugänglichkeit für Gäste” but this is not mentioned in the extracted requirements. Per the prompt, if the stakeholder doesn't object, this should be included as to-be-clarified.
    - **Reporting features:** The interviewer proposes “bestimmte Berichterstattungsfunktionen”, which the stakeholder does not reject, but this is absent from the requirements. 
    - **Data security or privacy:** The interviewer asks “gibt es spezifische Anforderungen in Bezug auf Datensicherheit und Datenschutz...?”—the stakeholder doesn't answer, so a “to be determined” requirement for security/privacy is needed.
    - **Agency selection process for external training:** The interviewer asks about the method for selecting training providers. The stakeholder does not answer, so this gap should be included.
    - **Budget and resource allocation for social media:** The question is asked about a set budget or resources, stakeholder does not answer, so a “to be determined” requirement is missing.
    - **Target audiences for social media:** The interviewer asks about Zielgruppen/markets for social media, stakeholder does not answer, so this should be marked as to be determined.
- **Technical/Non-functional requirements:**
    - There's an absence of explicit requirements for performance, reliability, or scalability, though ""reibungslos"", ""modern"", and ""Komplett digitalisieren"" suggest performance and reliability requirements (low error, high availability, etc.), which should be in the output.

**2. Misinterpreted Requirements:**
- **R27 (""The system shall meet usability standards to ensure a pleasant and seamless guest experience."") and R1 (""The organization shall provide guests with a pleasant and seamless stay at all of its resorts."")** are both loosely mapping to “Hauptziel meines Projektes ist Kunden einen möglichst angenehmen und reibungslosen Aufenthalt auf unseren Resorts zu bieten.” Only one is necessary, and splitting organizational vs. system usability quality is not cleanly justified by the quote.

**3. Compound Requirements:**
- **R17, R18, R19** all share the same source quote (""Ja ich möchte Online Reservierungen und Zahluingen ermöglichen sowie eine digitale verwaltung über alles inventar""). If the quote contains multiple needs, this is correct, but it might be more accurate to cite the entire interviewer-stakeholder exchange from that turn, to clarify context.
- **R10** (""The engaged social media agency shall also provide training to internal staff."") is redundant/overlapping with R9.

**4. Poor Phrasing:**
- Overuse of ""The system shall..."", regardless of what is clearly an organizational or process requirement (e.g., staff training, agency selection).
- Generic statements such as R21 (""The system shall demonstrate modern digital capabilities."") are too vague to be actionable or testable.
- Placeholder/uncertainty requirements (R12, R28) are sometimes too narrow (e.g., only about training, not about other aspects where no answer was given).

**5. Traceability Errors:**
- In multiple instances, the `source_quote` is just the most relevant stakeholder statement, but for implied requirements (where the interviewer mentions a feature/need and the stakeholder does not reject), the quote should include both the interviewer proposal and the stakeholder’s acceptance or non-rejection.
- Sometimes, the requirement is only partly supported by the cited quote, sometimes the quote does not include the part that justifies the requirement (e.g., for R26, the quote is about offered services, not about social media content supporting these services).

**Primary Failure Identified:**
The primary failure was **missing several requirements that were strongly implied by the transcript, especially those suggested by the interviewer and not explicitly rejected by the stakeholder (integration, mobile accessibility, reporting, data/privacy requirements, selection process, etc.)**. This is despite the prompt’s instruction to treat such suggestions as requirements-to-be-confirmed. Also, the requirement statements and traceability could be improved—a small number of requirements are too vague, or the traceability is incomplete for implied needs.

**Self-correction Strategy:**
- Provide **explicit, bolded guidance** to treat ALL interviewer suggestions (where not rejected) as requirements for further clarification, and require the agent to always quote BOTH interviewer AND stakeholder for context.
- Add emphasis on identifying ALL “to-be-determined” requirements whenever the stakeholder fails to answer a direct question about a system or process aspect (security, budget, selection, target, reporting, etc.).
- Require all source quotes for implied requirements to include both the suggestion and the (absence of) rejection.
- Instruct more precise atomicity in requirements: do not duplicate for organizational vs. system aspects unless justified, avoid redundant splits.
- Require that non-functional requirements also be inferred from adjectives, nouns, and context (e.g., ""modern"", ""reibungslos"", etc.), and account for quality attributes.
- Improve instructions on actionable, specific requirement phrasing.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to carefully analyze an interview transcript and extract all system requirements mentioned by the speaker.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, elicit all requirements (include both functional and non-functional requirements, you do not need to specify or categorize). Your primary goal is to capture the user's needs as accurately and completely as possible.

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The original source transcript.

**Constraint: Do not elicit more than 30 requirements.** Focus only on the most critical and distinct user needs mentioned in the transcript.

**Guidelines for High-Quality Requirements:**
To ensure the requirements you extract are clear and useful, please follow these best practices:
- **Clarity:** The requirement should have only one clear interpretation.
- **Atomicity:** Each requirement should describe a single, distinct need. Avoid combining multiple ideas into one statement.
- **Completeness:** The requirement statement should be a full sentence that expresses a complete thought.
- **Source-Based:** Every requirement you list must be directly supported by a statement or a strong implication from the transcript.

**Output Format:**
You MUST produce your output as a single, valid JSON object. The root key must be ""requirements"", which contains a list of individual requirement objects. Provide only the JSON and no other commentary.

Each requirement object in the list must have the following structure:
- `id`: A simple, unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
- `statement`: The requirement text, written as a clear, formal sentence (e.g., ""The system shall..."").
- `source_quote`: A direct, verbatim quote from the transcript that justifies the requirement, ensuring traceability. Give a literal quote, not a summary or paraphrase. Make sure the quotes are verbatim from the transcript.

**Example of the required JSON structure:**
```json

- **Atomicity:** Each requirement MUST address only one single, distinct user need or feature. If the transcript implies multiple separate functions or aspects, extract a separate requirement for each.
- **Direct Traceability:** Each requirement must be linked to a single, contiguous, verbatim quote from the transcript. Do not combine fragments or paraphrase quotes from the user or interviewer. Do not use interviewer suggestions unless directly affirmed by the stakeholder.
- **No Compound Requirements:** Never combine multiple capabilities, goals, or business needs into one requirement statement.
- **Verbatim Quotes Only:** Each `source_quote` MUST be a literal, word-for-word copy of exactly what the stakeholder said in the transcript (not the interviewer).
- **No Business Outcomes as Features:** If the user expresses a business motivation or intended outcome (e.g., ""increase revenue""), only elicit a requirement if the transcript also specifies a supporting system capability and quote that capability.
- **Precision and Clarity:** Avoid vague or generic business language in the requirement text. State exactly what the system must do.
- **Completeness:** Carefully read for any implied or explicit needs, ensuring no requirement is missed, and that similar but distinct features (e.g., reservations vs. bookings vs. hires) are separated.
- **Constraint on Quantity:** Do not elicit more than 30 requirements. Prioritize those that are most critical and directly justified by the transcript.

**Output Format:**
You MUST produce your output as a single, valid JSON object. The root key must be ""requirements"", containing a list of individual requirement objects. Provide only the JSON and no other commentary.

Each requirement object in the list must have this structure:
- `id`: A simple, unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
- `statement`: The requirement text, written as a clear, formal sentence (e.g., ""The system shall..."").
- `source_quote`: The direct, literal user quote from the transcript that justifies the requirement. If using user affirmation of an interviewer prompt, use only the stakeholder's direct response (e.g., ""Correct"").

**Example of the required JSON structure:**
```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall allow a user to register for a new account using an email address."",

{interview_transcript}
```";"**Step 1: Gap Analysis**

1. **Missing Requirements:**
   - **No explicit requirement regarding the preservation of existing data during transition.** The stakeholder describes existing locally stored data (""...the actual reservation and hire processes by telephone and fax as well as payments are all handled semi-manually at the resort and stored locally in a database...""). There is no requirement ensuring migration or preservation of legacy data.
   - **No requirement regarding competitive/innovative differentiation.** The requirement for the system to help compete in the market and be ""innovative"" (Stakeholder: ""im looking for innovative solutions that will help in competition with others"") is not directly captured. The closest is ""streamline business"" or exposure to a wider market, but not the explicit ambition for innovation/market differentiation.
   - **No mention of platform/device support or accessibility.** The stakeholder does not explicitly discuss support for mobile/web platforms or accessibility, but given the context of modern, ""nice"", ""online"" experience and implied customer diversity, a high-performing analyst may infer this requirement or at least flag its absence.
   - **No measurable success criteria or performance targets.** The transcript captures a desire for minimal disruption and business streamlining, but there are no requirements for specific performance, uptime, reliability, or success criteria beyond ""not disrupting current business too much.""

2. **Misinterpreted/Unsubstantiated Requirements:**
   - **R24**: ""The system shall expose the business to a larger customer community in the United States through online accessibility."" Although the Stakeholder says, ""This will not only increase the revenue by exposing business to a larger customer community in the whole US,"" this is a *benefit* or *motivation*, not a feature or capability. The requirement should focus on supporting online accessibility or multi-regional access, not guaranteeing exposure.
   - **R25/R30:** ""Streamline business operations/improved workflow"" repeats the same theme, with R25 vs. R30 only differing in wording.
   - **R11**: ""The system shall enable registered users to show proof of reservation upon arrival at the resort."" The quote is ""Yes a registration would be preferable for users to keep track of their reservation and show on sight."" The requirement's phrasing implies a specific ""proof"" feature, which is only weakly implied by the need to ""show on sight."" The need may be more accurately phrased as ""allow users to access their reservation details for presentation at the resort.""
   - **R28/R29:** Both requirements are derived from: ""They generate my reports for me, but maybe they could help maintain the website in future also."" However, ""help maintain the website"" could encompass a range of assistant roles, from technical maintenance to content updates. Ambiguity here could be better managed with clarification.

3. **Compound Requirements:**
   - **R1**: ""The system shall provide a centralized online platform to handle reservations, bookings, hires, and inventory management for all three Cool Ski Resorts."" This aggregates multiple core features in a single requirement. Best practice is to separate each major function (reservations, bookings, hires, inventory management, centralization).
   - **R6/R17:** Centric, database, and reporting needs could be better separated into distinct requirements.

4. **Traceability Errors:**
   - Some source quotes are slightly truncated or refer to paraphrased/combined statements rather than single, literal user quotes (e.g., R1's quote is only the start of the user's sentence, R16 uses a paraphrased version, R23 combines multiple clauses).
   - Several requirements use the Interviewer’s suggestions rather than only direct stakeholder statements as justification (some are valid due to stakeholder affirmation, others risk stretching the source-based rule).

5. **Poor Phrasing:**
   - Some requirements use generic business-ese (""streamline business"", ""improve efficiency"") without stating concrete system features or outcomes.
   - ""Exposing business to a larger community"" should be rephrased as actual system capabilities (multi-resort, public-facing, online, etc.).
   - ""Enable improved workflow beyond manual guidelines"" is circular and lacks specificity.

**Primary Failure of the Previous Attempt:**
The main failure is the presence of compound requirements that combine multiple user needs into single statements, leading to lack of atomicity and clarity. This not only hurts traceability but also results in missed or blurred distinctions between core functions (e.g., reservations, bookings, inventory, centralization). Additionally, some requirements rely on paraphrased or interviewer-prompt quotes rather than strictly verbatim stakeholder statements, reducing traceability.

**Step 2: Improvement Strategy**
- Explicitly instruct the analyst to separate any requirement covering more than one distinct feature or business need (""no compound requirements"").
- Mandate that each quoted phrase must be a single contiguous span from the transcript (verbatim, no paraphrase, no interviewer inference or combination).
- Add guidelines to ensure that vague business goals or motivations are not stated as features, but instead are mapped to system capabilities where direct support is indicated.
- Instruct the analyst to check for any requirements implied by user motivations in the transcript and, if cited, to frame those as supportable system capabilities (not outcomes).
- Directly call out and prohibit atomicity errors and the use of non-verbatim quotes.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to analyze the provided interview transcript and extract all system requirements, ensuring each is atomic, precisely stated, and directly traceable to explicit stakeholder input.

**Task:**  
From the provided interview transcript, elicit all system requirements (including both functional and non-functional requirements as appropriate). You must capture each distinct user need as a clear, atomic requirement, strictly supported by direct evidence from the transcript, with special attention to confirmed interviewer suggestions and maintaining strict verbatim traceability.

**Context Provided:**  
1. `{interview_transcript}`: The original source transcript.

**Critical Constraints:**  
- **Direct Stakeholder Input Only:** Only elicit requirements based on statements made or *explicitly affirmed* by the stakeholder. Do not invent requirements from interviewer suggestions unless the stakeholder directly confirms them.
- **Affirmed Interviewer Suggestions:** If the stakeholder confirms an interviewer suggestion (e.g., with ""Correct,"" ""Yes,"" or similar), you MUST include both the literal interviewer prompt and the stakeholder's direct response together as the `source_quote`, separated by ' / '. This is crucial for traceability (e.g., `""Would you like the system to provide reports on reservations, bookings, hires, and inventory across the three resorts? If so, could you describe the kind of reports that would be beneficial for your business?"" / Yes, reports that keep track of financial aspects regarding booking""`).
- **Verbatim Quotes:** Each requirement's `source_quote` MUST consist of either a contiguous, verbatim quote from the stakeholder or (if applicable) the contiguous interviewer suggestion joined with the stakeholder's confirming response as above.
- **Atomicity:** Each requirement must address only one feature, function, or non-functional property. If the transcript supports multiple distinct system capabilities, state each one as a separate requirement.
- **No Compound Requirements:** Do not combine multiple features or attributes into one statement. Split them as needed.
- **No Duplicates:** Do not include multiple requirements that restate or overlap on the same feature or function.
- **Comprehensiveness:** Carefully review the transcript for all expressly stated or strongly implied stakeholder needs, especially specific features or characteristics affirmed during interviewer suggestions. Do not omit requirements for confirmed, detailed features.
- **No Goal-Language or Business Outcomes:** Only express system features, constraints, or objectives that are described as system capabilities, not business outcomes (e.g., don't include ""streamline business"" unless accompanied by a direct system capability).
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** Explicitly extract requirements regarding the visual quality, usability, security, and other non-functional system aspects, if the stakeholder makes or affirms such statements.
- **Limit to 30:** Do not elicit more than 30 requirements, focus on the most critical and explicitly justified ones.

**Output Format:**  
Produce a single valid JSON object. The root key must be `""requirements""`, containing a list of individual requirement objects. Provide no output other than this JSON object.

Each requirement object must have this structure:
- `id`: A simple, unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
- `statement`: The requirement text, as a clear, formal sentence (e.g., ""The system shall..."").
- `source_quote`: The exact, verbatim user quote or (in the case of affirmations) [Interviewer Suggestion] / [Stakeholder Response], as described above.

**Example JSON Structure:**
```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",

````";"**Step 1: Gap Analysis**

1. **Missing Requirements:**
    - **Innovative Inventory Features Not Captured:** The stakeholder expressly affirmed the need for ""a system that provides real-time tracking of ski equipment availability, maintenance schedules, and rental history,"" including ""automatic alerts for low stock or equipment needing service, and integration with the booking system to reserve equipment in advance,"" by responding, ""Great this aligns with my vision."" The previous requirements list only generically asks for innovative inventory management, missing these specific, nuanced features.
    - **Visually Appealing Website:** The user said, ""I want a nice website..."" and the interviewer reaffirms ""an updated and visually appealing website"" in confirmation, affirmed by ""Yes, and in a way..."" Visually appealing as a non-functional requirement is not captured in the requirements.
    - **Reporting Needs—Scope Mistake:** The stakeholder requests ""reports that keep track of financial aspects regarding booking."" The agent only captured booking, but the transcript talks about assisting in reports for accounts and taxation. 
    - **Transition Support for Assistants Lacks Detail:** The agent cites ""Probably"" as justification for an atomic requirement about assistant training/support. However, ""Probably"" is vague, and the actual business process described for assistants supports reporting needs rather than maintenance (which is speculative).
    - **Requirement on Not Disrupting Business:** The agent includes ""minimize disruption"" as a requirement, quoting ""I wish for a digital solution withouut distrupting my current business too much,"" but the quote is a goal, not a capability, and does not describe a system feature or constraint directly justifiable per the prompt’s rules.
    - **No explicit requirement addressing migration of existing local data to the new system, which could be implied but is not stated by the stakeholder.**

2. **Misinterpreted Requirements:**
    - **Misuse of Interviewer Suggestions:** Several requirements are based on interviewer prompts (""Correct,"" ""Great this aligns with my vision"") with ""source_quote"" just being ""Correct."" This fails to include the actual substance of what was affirmed, violating direct traceability. The agent’s output should have instead included the interviewer's full suggestion followed by the user's affirmation as supporting evidence.
    - **Requirements for Reservations, Bookings, and Hires Conflated or Duplicated:** Multiple requirements (R1-R4, R16-R19, etc.) track the same concepts separately, sometimes redundantly: for example, ""providing centralized tracking of reservations"" and ""using a centralized database to keep track of reservations"" are essentially the same, leading to bloat.
    - **Compound Requirements:** ""The system shall allow users to keep track of their reservation via user registration."" This is two requirements: one for user registration, one for reservation tracking.

3. **Poor Phrasing:**
    - **Vague Requirements:** ""The system shall streamline business processes."" and ""The system shall minimize disruption..."" are vague and do not specify system behavior or characteristics.
    - **Goal-Language:** ""The system shall provide an innovative solution for inventory management that helps in competition with others."" This paraphrases a business goal, not a system requirement unless detailed with functional properties.

4. **Traceability Errors:**
    - **Inaccurate Source Quotes:** Quotes such as ""Correct"" or ""Probably"" are inadequate for traceability—these should be paired with the full interviewer statement being affirmed.
    - **Conflation of Interviewer and Stakeholder Words:** Some requirements use partial stakeholder quotes to represent requirements that are based on interviewer's prompted ideas.

**Step 2: Self-Correction Strategy**

- **Correct Use of Affirmations:** When the stakeholder affirms an interviewer's suggestion, use the *entire interviewer statement*, plus the stakeholder affirmation, as the source quote.
- **Atomicity Emphasized:** Instruct that only one feature or function per requirement is allowed.
- **Avoid Business Goals as Requirements:** Requirements must be about capabilities, features, or constraints, not high-level business objectives.
- **Specificity for Verbose Affirmations:** Make explicit in the prompt that, if a requirement is based on a user affirmation (e.g., “Correct”, “Great this aligns with my vision”), the exact interviewer’s statement being affirmed must be included in full as the `source_quote`, joined with the user’s affirmation.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** Explicitly instruct to extract non-functional requirements (e.g., ""visually appealing website"") if discussed.
- **No Duplicated/Overlapping Requirements:** Instruct to avoid stating the same requirement in multiple forms.
- **Report Features:** Clarify that reporting needs must accurately reflect the stakeholder’s specified scope (financial aspects), using the right verbatim quote.

**Primary Failure Summary:**  
The main failure was inadequate traceability for stakeholder-affirmed requirements (e.g., relying on ""Correct"" as a quote) and missed or misrepresented atomic, explicit features (especially regarding affirmed interviewer suggestions and specific innovative functionality). There were also vague, goal-oriented requirements and over-duplication.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to rigorously analyze an interview transcript and elicit all distinct and actionable system requirements expressed or implied by the speaker.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, extract all requirements (functional and non-functional) that are clearly stated or strongly implied by the stakeholder. Ensure that every distinct user need is represented as an *atomic* requirement in its own statement. Avoid paraphrasing, generalizing, or combining requirements: each statement must be linked explicitly to the speaker's intent and include only a single feature or change.

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The original source transcript.

**Special Instructions to Improve Quality and Traceability:**
- **Atomicity:** Each requirement must describe only one system feature, capability, or constraint. If the transcript mentions several related needs in a sentence, create separate requirements.
- **Completeness:** Each requirement must be a full sentence expressing a complete and actionable system capability, feature, or change.
- **Direct Support:** Only elicit requirements that are directly stated or can be strongly and clearly inferred from explicit stakeholder statements. Avoid speculation.
- **Verbatim Source:** For every requirement, include a full, accurate, *verbatim* quote from the transcript that supports that requirement. Do not use truncated, paraphrased, or summarized text, if the quote is only a phrase, include full contextual adjacent sentences for clarity wherever possible.
- **Avoid Generalization:** Do not convert motivational remarks (such as ""happy customers"") into generic requirements. Only create requirements about *concrete features or functions*.
- **Legacy Elimination:** When the transcript mentions an outdated or manual process (e.g., fax, wire, manual payments), explicitly create requirements to *replace* or *eliminate* these processes, as clearly implied by the stakeholder.
- **Payment Methods:** If more than one payment method is mentioned (e.g., wire transfer, PayPal), include a distinct requirement for each method, with traceable quotes.
- **Feature Names:** For transcript sections where features are listed only as names (e.g., “Inventory management”), use the verbatim feature name but seek full context from neighboring text in the transcript.
- **No Redundancy:** Avoid emitting requirements that duplicate the same user need. If in doubt, split requirements, do not merge them.

**Output Format:**
You MUST produce your output as a single, valid JSON object. The root key must be ""requirements"", containing a list of individual requirement objects. Provide only the JSON and no other commentary.

Each requirement object in the list MUST have the following structure:
- `id`: A simple, unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
- `statement`: The requirement text, written as a clear, formal sentence (e.g., ""The system shall..."").
- `source_quote`: The full, direct, verbatim quote from the transcript that justifies the requirement, ensuring traceability.

**Example of the required JSON structure:**
```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall allow a user to register for a new account using an email address and password."",
      ""source_quote"": ""So, obviously, a new user needs to be able to sign up, you know, just with their email.""
    }},
    {{
      ""id"": ""R2"",
      ""statement"": ""The system must load the main dashboard in under 2 seconds."",
      ""source_quote"": ""It's just got to be fast, I can't be waiting around for the main page to load.""
    }}
  ]
}}
```
**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT combine multiple capabilities, features, or constraints into a single requirement. Each must be atomic and directly supported. Ensure all source quotes are literal extracts from the transcript.

**Constraint: Do not elicit more than 30 requirements.** Focus only on the most critical and distinct user needs mentioned in the transcript.

**Begin your analysis using the following transcript:**
{interview_transcript}
```";"**1. Missing Requirements:**
- **Payment Methods:** The transcript includes ""The customer should wire us the money"" as the preferred payment method. The agent captured only PayPal-related requirements and omitted any reference to wire transfers. This is a direct omission.
- **Current Limitations/Implied Transformation:** The transcript discusses the limitations of current room booking (""Currently, one can only book a room via fax or telephone"") and payments (""payments are all handled semi-manually at the resort""), yet the requirements list does not explicitly state requirements to *replace* fax/telephone and manual payment handling with online capabilities. A single requirement references ""eliminating the current dependence on fax or telephone,"" but does not directly mention moving *all* payments online.
- **No explicit requirement referencing ""We do not have a system for providing weather information"".** The requirements reference weather and snow condition features, but no explicit requirement to *introduce* such a system (i.e., ""The system shall introduce weather and snow condition information for customers"").
- **Stakeholder Identity:** The transcript establishes ""Jim is the owner."" No requirements reference admin or owner functionality, which could be implied by stakeholder position.

**2. Misinterpreted Requirements:**
- **Customer Satisfaction (""Happy customers""):** The agent created ""The system shall be designed to maximize customer satisfaction.” This is a vague generalization rather than a concrete requirement. Stakeholder’s intent was to motivate the design, not specify a technical/system requirement. Instead, requirements should detail *features that create satisfaction* rather than using this abstract statement.
- **Atomicity Issues:** Several requirements (e.g., R4: ""The system shall provide seasonal pricing information for each room"" sourced from ""The ability to see and choose a room and seeing the difference in prices for each season"") partially combine multiple ideas. Likewise, R20 (""The system shall provide an online reservation process that is less manual for both payments and booking procedures"") is compound because it deals with both booking and payments in one statement.

**3. Compound Requirements:**
- **R4/R18**: Overlapping elements regarding viewing, choosing rooms, and seeing seasonal pricing are split or repeated (atomicity concern and risk of redundancy).
- **R20:** ""Booking process and payment procedures"" in one requirement.

**4. Poor Phrasing:**
- **Generic Requirements:** ""The system shall be designed to maximize customer satisfaction"" is vague and not actionable.
- **R18 (""The system shall allow customers to view all available rooms before making a reservation"")** and R3 (""The system shall display the availability status..."") are highly similar—possibly redundant.

**5. Traceability Errors:**
- Most `source_quote` references are reasonable, but in a few cases, the quote is not fully verbatim:
    - In R11, the quote provided (""Customers should be able ... query weather and snow conditions and so on."") is truncated, not verbatim.
    - R5: The quote is just ""Paypal""—too minimal for traceability/context.
    - R13 (""Inventory management"") and R14 (""booking training classes"") use just the feature names, not full transcript statements, which may harm traceability.
    - Several requirements have composite statements with source quotes that capture only one aspect.

**Primary Failure:**
- The agent failed to ensure strict atomicity, completeness, and verbatim traceability. It also missed requirements (e.g., wire transfer, explicit elimination of legacy methods, owner/admin features) and created vague requirements (e.g., maximizing customer satisfaction).
- The requirements sometimes paraphrase or conflate ideas, leading to inaccurate traceability and missed user needs.

**Improvement Strategy:**
- Explicitly require all *distinct* user needs stated or strongly implied in the transcript be emitted as separate atomic requirements.
- Demand that every requirement be directly supported by a *full verbatim* quote, even if the quote consists of only a phrase (but require adjacent context if available).
- Instruct the agent NOT to generalize motivational remarks (e.g., ""Happy customers"") into requirements unless supported by an explicit feature or capability.
- Include a step for mapping *all* payment methods (wire transfer and PayPal) mentioned, not only the most recent.
- Make the agent check for current limitations stated and require requirements for transforming them (i.e., ""eliminate manual payments,"" ""eliminate fax/telephone bookings"").
- For features listed only by name (""Inventory management""), require the use of the full transcript reference and, if possible, prompt for adjacent clarifying context.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst specializing in strict requirements traceability. Your task is to rigorously analyze the provided interview transcript and elicit every distinct, actionable system requirement directly expressed or strongly implied by the stakeholder.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, extract all requirements—both functional and non-functional—that are clearly stated or can be strongly and unambiguously inferred from the stakeholder’s words. Each user need must be expressed as a separate, *atomic* requirement.

**Special instructions to ensure maximum quality and traceability:**

1. **Atomicity:**  
   - Each requirement must represent a *single, indivisible* system capability, feature, or constraint. If the transcript mentions multiple features in one sentence, separate them into distinct requirements.

2. **Completeness:**  
   - Each requirement must be a *full sentence* that is explicit, self-contained, and actionable (e.g., “The system shall allow…” or “The system must…”).

3. **Direct Support & Avoid Generalization:**  
   - ONLY include requirements that are *explicitly stated* or can be strongly and clearly inferred from direct stakeholder statements. **Do not speculate or generalize** system features or changes beyond the given transcript.

4. **Full Verbatim Source Quote:**  
   - For each requirement, provide a *full, literal, verbatim* quote from the transcript as `source_quote`, demonstrating traceability.  
   - **Never use only a single word or short phrase as the source quote.** If the quote is short or ambiguous, expand to include the *entire conversational turn* and, if necessary, relevant adjacent context (e.g., the interviewer’s question and the stakeholder’s full reply).
   - Your goal is to **maximize traceability**—make it clear beyond doubt what part of the stakeholder dialogue supports each requirement.

5. **Legacy Elimination Requirements:**  
   - When the transcript mentions discontinuing or replacing outdated or manual processes (e.g., fax, phone, manual payment), explicitly create requirements to eliminate or replace these methods, as appropriate.

6. **No Over-interpretation of Payment:**  
   - When the transcript specifies certain payment methods (e.g., wire transfer, PayPal), create distinct requirements only for those exact methods, not general “online payments,” unless more general modalities are supported by explicit stakeholder statements.

7. **Compound and Redundant Requirement Checks:**  
   - Do not create requirements that combine more than one capability.  
   - Before finalizing your list, check for semantic redundancy. If two requirements cover essentially the same user need, retain the most granular, directly supported one.

8. **Feature Names & Context:**  
   - If the transcript gives only a feature name (e.g., ""Inventory management""), construct the requirement using that name, but include the full sentence, question, or context in which it appeared as the source quote.

9. **Scope Limit:**  
   - Do not output more than 30 requirements. If there are more, prioritize those most critical and directly specified in the transcript.

10. **No Motivational Requirements:**  
    - Do not turn stakeholder motivations (e.g., “happy customers”) into requirements—only capture concrete system behaviors and features.

**Output Format:**
Your output MUST be a single, valid JSON object with the root key ""requirements"", containing a list of individual requirement objects.

Each requirement object MUST have the following structure:
- `id`: A unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
- `statement`: The requirement as a clear, formal English sentence.
- `source_quote`: The *full, verbatim* transcript quote (contextualized as needed for traceability).

**Example:**
```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall allow a user to register for a new account using an email address and password."",
      ""source_quote"": ""So, obviously, a new user needs to be able to sign up, you know, just with their email.""
    }},
    {{
      ""id"": ""R2"",
      ""statement"": ""The system must load the main dashboard in under 2 seconds."",
      ""source_quote"": ""It's just got to be fast, I can't be waiting around for the main page to load.""
    }}
  ]
}}
```

**Critical Notes:**
- **Be diligent in using full, rich quotes as `source_quote` for every requirement.**
- **Do not paraphrase the stakeholder’s statements—rely only on their actual words.**
- **If in doubt about the support for a requirement, err on the side of excluding it.**
- **Never combine multiple capabilities into a single requirement, split them as needed.**
- **No output other than the specified JSON format.**

{interview_transcript}
````";"**Step 1: Gap Analysis**

**A. Missing Requirements**

- **Lack of requirement regarding the *consolidation* of three websites into a single (centralized) platform.**  
  While there are requirements about centralizing data and preventing double bookings (R4, R5, R6), the *explicit need* to have a **single website/interface/platform** for all three ski resorts is *split* and *ambiguous*.  
- **No atomic requirement for “customers should be able to reserve a room and query weather and snow conditions and so on.”**  
  The agent split the sentence into two, which is correct for “reserve a room” and “query weather/snow,” but it did not address the clause “and so on” (possible ambiguity, but may hint at more features not followed up).
- **No explicit requirement for “see what is available in each resort.”**  
  This is a core user function, but it is partially captured in R10 (“allow customers to view room availability for each resort”) and R15/16. However, the *distinction* between viewing “what is available” (which might include more than just rooms—possibly services, classes, etc.) and just room availability is muddied.
- **No atomic requirement(s) for “promotion and advertisement through social media as well as weather and snow condition forecasts for customers **staying at the resort**”**  
  The agent listed social media promotions (R11), but didn’t capture the possible nuance of providing weather info specifically to “customers staying” at the resort.
- **“Inventory management and booking training classes”**  
  Both features are listed, but “inventory management” is not expanded—should possibly explicitly address managing resort assets/rooms separately if a quote supports it.
- **Prioritization of features**  
  The order is recited in the transcript, but not addressed as a requirement or as priority (perhaps because the prompt says not to create requirements out of prioritization). However, clarity on priorities might help downstream.
- **Lack of explicit requirement regarding the *user type* of “customers”**  
  Many requirements say “customers”, but the transcript never specifies staff/admin needs—the absence of other roles is correct, but should be highlighted as evidence of correct omission.
- **Redundant/Overlapping Requirements**  
  E.g., R4 (“centralize booking data for all three ski resorts into a single system”) and R5 (“consolidate the three current independent resort websites into a centralized platform”)—these likely stem from the same quote but represent distinct atomic needs: data vs. interface. However, their linkage should be checked for redundancy.
- **No mention of automated booking confirmations (except for PayPal payment confirmation and receipts).**  
  It is not clear if booking confirmation (distinct from payment) is required.
- **""Happy customers""**  
  As required, this was *not* translated into a requirement, which is correct.

**B. Misinterpreted Requirements**

- **R20: “replace semi-manual payment handling at the resort with online payments.”**  
  The stakeholder only explicitly mentions wire transfers and PayPal. The term “online payments” might be a generalization, as wire transfers may or may not be “online” in a UX sense. The agent should remain closer to the transcript and avoid generalization.
- **R8 (“aesthetically pleasing to users”) and R9 (“intuitive user interface”)**  
  Both come from one quote, however, “aesthetically pleasing” and “intuitive” are NFRs, but are appropriately split. No misinterpretation, just a note.

**C. Compound Requirements**

- **R5 and R4**  
  Might be overlapping, but upon review, are atomic: interface consolidation (R5) vs. booking data (R4).
- **R10 vs. R15**  
  ""View room availability for each resort"" (R10) vs. ""view available rooms across all resorts"" (R15) — semantically similar, potentially redundant unless the transcript specifically distinguishes the two views.
- **R23/R24**  
  Both derive from one “Yes both of them” answer and are therefore correctly split.

**D. Poor/Unclear Phrasing**

- Generally, the statements are clear and formal, e.g., “The system shall…”
- Some requirements could be more tightly scoped to the specific verbatim quote, e.g., “The system shall provide a new website for the business” vs. “The system shall provide a new website for the business that looks good.” A portion of the business intent (“looks good”) is omitted. The NFR is instead captured in a separate requirement.

**E. Traceability Errors**

- Some `source_quote` fields are very brief fragments, e.g., just “PayPal” for R22.  
  The prompt instructed agents: ""If the quote is only a phrase, include full contextual adjacent sentences for clarity wherever possible."" Many such quotes are minimal and lack sufficient context for robust traceability.
- The agent sometimes truncates multi-sentence stakeholder turns, opting for partial phrases rather than full, contextual quotes.

**Summary of Main Failures**

1. **Primary Failure:** Many `source_quote` fields are truncated or lack full context, negatively impacting traceability and auditability.
2. **Secondary Issue:** Slight generalization/over-interpretation (e.g., R20’s “online payments”), which introduces risks that the requirement goes beyond direct stakeholder intent.
3. **Minor/Clarity:** A couple of requirements are potentially redundant (room availability globally vs. per resort).

**Self-Correction Strategy**

- **Make explicit, in bold, the expectation that all `source_quote` fields must be as full and contextual as possible, including the surrounding dialogue in the transcript, not just the minimal phrase.**
- **Directly warn the agent *not* to use single-word or short phrase quotes, when the transcript provides only a phrase, instruct the agent to expand with full sentences from the same conversational turn or adjacent utterances.**
- **Caution the agent not to generalize process improvements or payment modalities beyond what is specified or implied by the stakeholder, and to be conservative when defining concrete features.**
- **Add a requirement to cross-check for redundancy and, where requirements are potentially duplicative, to select the most granular/atomic phrasing directly tied to the transcript.**
- **Clarify that when creating requirements from feature-lists or straw-man options, contextualize precisely what the stakeholder agreed to (i.e., only include the requirement if the stakeholder affirms its value).**

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to carefully analyze an interview transcript and extract all system requirements mentioned by the speaker.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, elicit all requirements (include both functional and non-functional requirements, you do not need to specify or categorize). Your primary goal is to capture the user's needs as accurately and completely as possible.

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The original source transcript.

**Constraint: Do not elicit more than 30 requirements.** Focus only on the most critical and distinct user needs mentioned in the transcript.

**Guidelines for High-Quality Requirements:**
To ensure the requirements you extract are clear and useful, please follow these best practices:
- **Clarity:** The requirement should have only one clear interpretation.
- **Atomicity:** Each requirement should describe a single, distinct need. Avoid combining multiple ideas into one statement.
- **Completeness:** The requirement statement should be a full sentence that expresses a complete thought.
- **Source-Based:** Every requirement you list must be directly supported by a statement or a strong implication from the transcript.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your responsibility is to carefully review an interview transcript and identify **all functional and non-functional system requirements** expressed or implied by the interviewee, ensuring each user need is captured as an atomic, traceable, and unambiguous requirement.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, extract **every distinct requirement** mentioned by the speaker, including those that are strongly implied based on context, existing process descriptions, or user frustrations/aspirations. Your goal is to produce a complete and accurate record of all critical system requirements for implementation.

**Special Instructions:**
- Whenever a single quote or user statement expresses **multiple distinct needs**, split them so that each atomic need is a separate requirement, each with its own requirement object. For example, if a user says “...handle reservations, bookings, payments...”, create separate requirements for handling reservations, bookings, and payments, all justified by the same quote.
- **Look for implied requirements**: When the user describes problems with current workflows, coordination between locations, migration away from manual systems, or expressing hopes for business process automation or consolidation, extract requirements that address these needs, even if not worded as feature requests. Use stakeholder complaints or business context as justification if necessary.
- **Do not add speculative technical details** unless the original transcript mentions them by name. Only refer to platforms, integrations, or methods that are directly named (e.g., PayPal, Google Reviews, etc.).
- **Verbatim traceability is mandatory**: For each requirement, include a literal, word-for-word source quote from the transcript that most clearly justifies or introduces the requirement (even for implied requirements—choose the relevant pain-point or context statement).
- **Do NOT combine multiple requirements into one statement**: Each statement must describe only a single, distinct system need.

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The original interview transcript.

**Constraint: Do not elicit more than 30 requirements.** Focus on the most critical and distinct user needs mentioned or implied in the transcript.

**Guidelines for High-Quality Requirements:**
- **Atomicity:** Every requirement must be split so that only one feature, capability, or system quality is described per statement.
- **Clarity:** Wording must allow only one reasonable interpretation.
- **Completeness:** Each requirement must be a full sentence, standalone, and actionable for technical teams.
- **Source-Based:** Each requirement must be justified with a verbatim quote from the transcript, including for requirements derived from pain-points or context.
- **Accuracy:** Do not invent technological specifics that the user did not mention.

**Output Format:**
You MUST produce your output as a single, valid JSON object. The root key must be ""requirements"", which contains a list of individual requirement objects.

Each requirement object in the list must have the following structure:
- `id`: A simple, unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
- `statement`: The requirement text, written as a clear, formal sentence (e.g., ""The system shall..."").
- `source_quote`: A direct, verbatim quote from the transcript that justifies the requirement, ensuring traceability. Use word-for-word sourcing, even if multiple requirements come from the same quote.

**Example of the required JSON structure:**
```json

**Begin extraction now using the following transcript:**
{interview_transcript}
```";"**1. Missing Requirements:**
- **No requirements captured for cross-resort coordination.** The stakeholder mentions, ""The amount of coordination required among three resorts is mounting and I have decided to streamline the business in an innovative way."" Nowhere is the requirement for facilitating coordination or consolidated management across multiple resorts articulated.
- **No explicit requirement about administrative/assistant role automation.** The stakeholder describes that “I have assistants to manage the accounts and the taxation work for the businesses in each resort. The assistants also keep track of financial aspects regarding booking.” A requirement to automate or support these business/administrative processes is not drawn out.
- **Lack of system requirements regarding data migration from manual to digital.** The transition from semi-manual (telephone, fax, local DB) to a digital/online system is clear but not addressed as a requirement for data migration or onboarding existing records.
- **No requirement on multi-language support or accessibility features.** While not directly stated, the focus on being ""intuitive"" and covering various customer needs might imply accessibility, but the agent did not consider or elicit such non-functional user needs.
- **No requirement on security, privacy, or data protection, despite financial/transparency mentions.**

**2. Misinterpreted/Overlapping Requirements:**
- **Compound statements:** 
  - *R1 (""The system shall provide an online interface for handling reservations, bookings, and payments."")* covers three distinct functions—this should be split.
  - *R8 and R9 (""The system shall reduce the required number of staff..."" and ""The system shall enhance transparency..."")* are both traced to the same combined quote, which itself compound two wishes. Each could be broken out further.
  - *R22 and R23 (""process bookings instantly"" and ""ensure that the booking process is easy"")*—the source quote covers ""easy and instantly,"" so these two are correctly split, but the agent could be more consistent elsewhere.

**3. Poor Phrasing/Completeness:**
- Several requirements repeat or overlap in coverage (e.g., R2 overlaps with R21). 
- R15 (""The system shall integrate with a wide range of payment methods, including credit/debit cards and online payment services like PayPal."")—the quote is just “As many as possible,” making explicit payment types not justified by the transcript—thus, traceability is weakened.
- Some requirements use imprecise or general terminology: For example, R15, R16, and R17 reference specifics in their statements (PayPal, etc., “the best local services”) that are not strictly present in the quoted stakeholder answer, thus, this is a traceability error.

**4. Traceability Errors:**
- *R15*: The statement includes ""PayPal"" and card types, the source quote is only ""As many as possible""—statement over-specifies beyond the verbatim quote.
- Similar in several other requirements—agent sometimes speculates or embellishes.

**5. Additional Notes:**
- The prompt does ask for atomicity, traceability, etc., but the agent does not always split or phrase requirements atomically, nor always use accurate verbatim quotes for justification.
- The agent does not explicitly handle implicit requirements, nor does the prompt explicitly permit extraction of requirements based on strong implication.
- The prompt does not explicitly state that *distinct* requirements should be split across all business processes mentioned, particularly when the quote contains multiple needs.

**Primary Failure:**
**The main failure was the insufficient capture of certain requirements that were either implicit or clearly stated but not atomicized (e.g., business process coordination, migration from manual to digital, administrative automation, and data consolidation across resorts). The prompt’s instructions do not strongly emphasize the identification of every distinct implied system need (especially regarding cross-resort operations or transition from existing manual workflows), nor do they force the agent to split out all atomically distinct requirements whenever a source quote contains several wishes in a single sentence.**

**Self-Correction Strategy:**
- Explicitly tell the agent to extract all implicit requirements where there is strong evidence (such as those relating to current problems and new goals—migration, coordination, and automation).
- Insist, with examples, that each requirement must express a single, atomic, and traceably supported need (even when combined in one stakeholder quote—split and justify each with the same quote if needed).
- Increase emphasis on not over-specifying or assuming technological specifics that are not stated in the transcript (to avoid traceability errors).
- Clearly instruct the agent to search for requirements stemming from current pain-points and business context, not just explicit “wants.”

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst specializing in precise, comprehensive requirements extraction for digital systems. Your primary objective is to analyze a provided interview transcript and extract **every functional and non-functional requirement**—explicit or implied—stated or strongly suggested by the stakeholder.

**Key Extraction Principles:**
- **Exhaustive Specificity:** You must capture each detail named in the transcript, especially explicit references to named systems, platforms, or sources (e.g. “Twitter,” “Facebook,” “Instagram,” “Google Reviews,” “the best local services” for weather, “rentals and inventory of utilities”). Do NOT generalize these as generic platforms.
- **Atomicity Required:** If a single stakeholder sentence or phrase mentions more than one feature, system, or outcome—even by list or implication—split these into separate requirements, each with an individual requirement object and dedicated source quote. Every requirement must describe only a single capability, quality, integration, or process.
- **Implied Needs:** Stakeholder context about frustrations, manual effort, or aspirations (such as “less staff,” “more transparency,” “mounting coordination,” accounting and taxation processes, etc.) must be translated into actionable system requirements, justified by the pain-point or context quote.
- **Verbatim Traceability:** For each requirement, choose the most directly relevant and literal quote from the transcript that supports that requirement. DO NOT paraphrase or combine multiple transcript statements into a single quote. Use the stakeholder’s words wherever possible.
- **Named Platform Adherence:** Only include specific integrations, services, or features if they are named by the stakeholder. Do not add speculative technology unless it is directly stated in the transcript.
- **Full Requirement Statements:** Each requirement must be written as a clear, formal, actionable, and unambiguous sentence (beginning “The system shall…” or “The website shall…” as appropriate).
- **Separation of Functional/Non-Functional Needs:** Clarity, usability, intuitiveness, reduction of manual work, transparency, aesthetics, etc., must each be rendered as individually actionable requirements, not combined.

**Instructions:**
1. Review the transcript below thoroughly.
2. Extract every distinct atomic requirement mentioned or implied by the stakeholder, focusing especially on:
    - Each item in user lists (features, platforms, add-ons).
    - Process improvements or pain points (even if not phrased as a system wish).
    - Named platforms/services (list each separately).
    - Outcome-focused statements (transparency, staff reduction, intuitiveness, etc.).
    - Specific types/categories of inventory or business functions referenced.
3. Attribute to each requirement a verbatim, self-contained quote from the transcript which most directly justifies the requirement (one quote per requirement).
4. Avoid overgeneralization. Retain the stakeholder’s specificity (e.g., require “inventory of rentals and utilities” if that’s what is said, not just “inventory”).
5. Do NOT combine requirements, do not exceed 30 requirements, and only list what is critically and distinctly supported by the transcript.

**Output Format:**
Structure your output as a single, valid JSON object using the following template:

```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall ..."",
      ""source_quote"": ""...""

    {{
      ""id"": ""R2"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall ..."",
      ""source_quote"": ""...""

    // etc., up to 30 requirements

Stakeholder: I am in line with the scope  
Stakeholder: No  
Interviewer: Great to hear! To start off, could you please introduce yourself and your connection to this project?  
Stakeholder: Hello  
Interviewer: Hello, I'm GPTREI, your requirements elicitation assistant. Today, I will be gathering detailed information about your project needs to ensure we understand all requirements clearly. Before we begin, are you in line with the scope of this interview, or do your expectations of this interview differ?  
Stakeholder: I am a staff member of the resort in charge of implementing a online management system  
Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. How would you describe the online management system project in two to four sentences?  
Stakeholder: We want to be able to handle reservations, bookings, payments and our website digitally. Also we would like to be present on social media to promote our resort  
Interviewer: Thank you for that overview. Could you describe the current process or systems you use for handling reservations, bookings, payments, your website, and social media presence?  
Stakeholder: Thanks  
Stakeholder: Currently all the resorts have a simple system for all reservation and hire by telephone and fax and the payments are all handled semi-manually at the resort and are stored in a local database of each resort. I have assistants to manage the accounts and the taxation work for the businesses in each resort. The assistants also keep track of financial aspects regarding booking. The amount of coordination required among three resorts is mounting and I have decided to streamline the business in an innovative way.To  
Interviewer: Thank you for providing those details. Based on what you've shared, what are the main features or improvements you hope to gain from implementing this online management system?  
Interviewer: Including a new logo design is noted. Based on your description, do you think having an integrated feedback system for customer reviews on your website would also be beneficial?  
Stakeholder: Less staff, more transparency in the booking process, An aesthetically pleasing and intuitive website for customers to see what is available in each resort Online hotel reservation, hiring, and booking training classes Inventory management Promotion and advertisement through social media Query weather and snow condition forecasts for customers staying at the resort  
Interviewer: So, the features and improvements you're looking for include reducing staff, enhancing transparency in the booking process, creating an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive website, implementing online hotel reservation and booking for training classes, managing inventory, promoting through social media, and providing weather and snow condition forecasts. Is that correct? Are there any other features you would like to include in this project?  
Stakeholder: Maybe a new logo  
Stakeholder: Yes  
Interviewer: Thank you for confirming. Now, could you prioritize these features in terms of importance and immediate need for your project? If you need assistance with prioritization, I can help.  
Stakeholder: Help  
Interviewer: Certainly! Let's go through them, and I'll suggest a priority order based on typical business needs, but feel free to adjust based on your specific goals:  

1. **Website Development**: Since this serves as your digital front and point of contact for customers, making it intuitive and aesthetically pleasing is critical.  
2. **Online Reservations and Bookings**: Automating the reservation system can greatly enhance transparency and efficiency.  
3. **Payment Processing System**: Streamlining payments will reduce manual work and potential errors.  
4. **Social Media Integration for Promotion**: Building a social media presence can help drive new customer engagement.  
5. **Weather and Snow Forecast Integration**: Useful for informing and attracting customers.  
6. **Inventory Management**: Necessary to keep track of resources and supplies.  
7. **Feedback System**: Valuable for improving customer experience based on their inputs.  
8. **Logo Design**: Important for branding but can coordinate concurrently with other features.  

Does this order align with your preferences, or would you like to adjust it?  
Stakeholder: Looks perfect  
Interviewer: Great! Let's start by gathering detailed requirements for the top-priority feature, the website development. Please elaborate on what you want this new website to accomplish and any specific functionalities or design aspects you envision.  
Stakeholder: I dont have time to elaborate on all but sure. The website should be intuitive for the user and bookings should be made easily and istantly  
Stakeholder: Open to new  
Interviewer: Thank you for that. To better understand your requirements, could you describe any specific elements or features you envision on your website that would make it intuitive and streamline the booking process for users?  
Stakeholder: Clear buttons that indicate where you can inform yourself about the offer and where you can book  
Interviewer: Great! Clear buttons are crucial for navigation. Are there any particular design styles or themes you have in mind for these buttons and the overall website? For example, do you have a certain color scheme, imagery, or layout style you'd like to implement?  
Stakeholder: No i dont know about that, it should be ski themed of course  
Interviewer: Understood, a ski-themed design will be fitting for your resort. We can work with designers to incorporate elements like snowy landscapes, skiing activities, and appropriate color palettes to convey the theme. Moving on, let's discuss the online reservation and booking functionality. Could you describe how you would like the booking process to work for your customers?  
Stakeholder: Step by step, with the option for add ons or customizations  
Interviewer: Thank you. A step-by-step booking process with options for add-ons or customizations can be very user-friendly. Could you provide examples of the types of add-ons or customizations you envision offering during the booking process?  
Stakeholder: With flight, breakfast included, just hostel and no ski pass, bus ticket, restaurant vouchers, insurance  
Interviewer: Those are excellent add-ons to offer. Now, regarding the payment processing system, do you have any specific payment methods or platforms in mind that you would like to integrate into this system? For example, credit/debit cards, PayPal, or other online payment services?  
Stakeholder: As many as possible  
Interviewer: Including a wide range of payment options will indeed cater to more customers. Next, let's talk briefly about the social media promotion feature. Do you have specific social media platforms in mind that you'd like to focus on? For instance, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.  
Stakeholder: Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram  
Interviewer: Thank you for specifying those platforms. For the weather and snow forecast integration, do you have any preferred sources or services you wish to use for providing accurate forecasts to your customers?  
Stakeholder: The best local services  
Interviewer: Great, utilizing the best local services for accurate weather and snow forecasts is a practical approach. As for inventory management, are there specific types of inventory you need to track, such as equipment or supplies, that are essential for your resort's operation?  
Stakeholder: Yes all rentals and inventory of utilities etc in the house  
Interviewer: Thank you for clarifying. For the feedback system, how would you like customers to leave reviews or feedback on your website? For example, through a rating system, written reviews, or both?  
Stakeholder: Through google  
Interviewer: Integrating Google Reviews for collecting customer feedback is a solid choice. Lastly, for the new logo, do you have any existing design elements or ideas you'd like to incorporate, or will you be open to fresh concepts from designers?  
Interviewer: Perfect, being open to new concepts gives designers creative freedom to craft something unique for your brand. As we wrap up, who else do you think has valuable insights into the project, and whose needs need to be considered, and why?  
Stakeholder: No  
Interviewer: Thank you for confirming. To summarize, we've discussed a ski-themed, intuitive website with a streamlined booking process, various add-ons, a broad range of payment methods, social media promotions, local weather forecasts, inventory management, Google integrated feedback, and the development of a new logo. Is there anything else you'd like to add or modify?  
Interviewer: Thank you for your valuable insights. We will follow up with any additional questions or clarifications needed. Based on our discussion, I will prepare a detailed summary and share it with you for review. If there's anything further you need, feel free to reach out. Have a great day!  
Interviewer: You're welcome! Thank you for your time, and have a wonderful day!
```";"**1. Gap Analysis:**  
Below are the results of comparing the requirements output to the transcript:

**A. Missing Requirements:**

- **Named Social Media Platforms:**  
  The stakeholder specifies: “Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.” The requirements only mention generic “social media,” never explicitly these three platforms.
  
- **Preference for ""Best Local"" Weather and Snow Forecast Services:**  
  The requirement simply says to provide up-to-date forecasts. The stakeholder says, ""The best local services,"" which implies a specific requirement to use trusted or best-in-area sources—not just any forecast provider.
  
- **Inventory: Rentals and Utilities:**  
  Stakeholder specifies, ""all rentals and inventory of utilities etc in the house."" The requirement generically covers ""resort resources and supplies,"" which dilutes the specificity/traceability needed.

- **Current Process Context – Accounting and Taxation Tracking:**  
  It is mentioned in the transcript:  
  “I have assistants to manage the accounts and taxation work for the businesses in each resort. The assistants also keep track of financial aspects regarding booking.”  
  No requirement addresses automation/support for accounting, taxation, or financial reporting functions currently handled manually/unautomatically.

- **Requirement for Accepting a Broad Range of Payment Methods:**  
  “As many as possible” is present, but the stakeholder was prompted about examples such as PayPal, credit/debit cards, etc. The requirement is not explicit that only platforms *named in the transcript* can be included, and should reference this.
  
**B. Misinterpreted Requirements:**

- **Requirement R4:**   
  ""The system shall facilitate digital management of the resort’s website.""  
  The traceability is vague: ""We want to be able to handle reservations, bookings, payments and our website digitally."" But the intent was to *enable online workflows overall*, this could be better split, and the phrase doesn't clearly map to “website management” as a feature.

- **Compound Requirements:**  
  Some requirements, such as R6 and R8, partially combine more than one aspect.  
    - R6: ""replace manual telephone and fax-based reservation and hire processes with automated online workflows"" touches on both automating reservations and the ""hire"" process (for training, equipment, etc.), but doesn't split them out, and doesn't make clear from the transcript if ""hire"" means ""equipment rental"".
    - R8: ""support reduction in required staff for business processes through automation"" conflates outcome (""less staff"") and feature (""automation""), they should be separated: one functional (automation), one non-functional (system should enable staffing reduction).

- **R10:**   
  ""present each resort’s available offers in a clear and visually appealing manner"" derived from ""An aesthetically pleasing and intuitive website for customers to see what is available in each resort""—the phrase should not assume “offers” unless explicit in transcript—it should stick with “availability/information”.

**C. Poor Phrasing:**

- Several requirements refer to “the system” when sometimes “the website” is intended (especially for user/customer-facing features).
- Phrases such as “facilitate digital management…” are buzzword-heavy and may not be directly actionable.

**D. Traceability Errors:**

- Some requirements have ambiguous or truncated source quotes (especially R8-R9 which try to cover multiple features with one quote).
- R30: ""Through google"" as a source quote is vague and incomplete for “integration with Google Reviews”, needs to specify context.

**Primary Failure:**
  
**The main failure was inadequate extraction of all explicit and implicit requirements named by the stakeholder, especially those related to:**
- specific platform and service preferences (named social media, weather source, reviews),
- business process automation needs (accounting, taxation),
- clear, atomic splitting of requirements where user statements referenced multiple features,
- and consistently using verbatim, specific quotes for traceability.

Additionally, the previous prompt failed to:
- force the agent to check for requirements that are *named with specificity* (e.g. ""Twitter"" not just ""social media""),
- instruct the agent to call out vague non-functional desires (e.g. “reduce staff,” “increase transparency”) and connect them to system features where possible,
- direct the agent to rephrase requirement statements in direct alignment with stakeholder wording when possible.

**Self-Correction Strategy:**

- Emphasize in the prompt the need for *precise matching* to explicit platforms/services (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Google Reviews, “best local services” for weather).
- Make explicit the requirement to capture *all* business process automation opportunities mentioned—accounting, taxation—even if not called out as a system wish.
- Ensure *atomicity* by instructing the agent not only to break up lists (reservations, bookings, payments), but to do so for any statement referencing multiple features, outputs, platforms, or processes.
- Reinforce that only *verbatim source quotes* may be used for traceability, and encourage the agent to pick the *most specific, relevant* transcript line for each requirement.
- Explicitly require that functional and non-functional requirements (e.g., for website intuitiveness, ease, staff reduction, transparency) be captured as separate, actionable, atomic requirements.
- Instruct the agent to *avoid paraphrasing* the source quotes, and to never conflate multiple source quotes within one requirement.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to carefully analyze an interview transcript and extract all system requirements mentioned by the speaker.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, elicit all requirements (include both functional and non-functional requirements, you do not need to specify or categorize). Your primary goal is to capture the user's needs as accurately and completely as possible.

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The original source transcript.

**Constraint: Do not elicit more than 30 requirements.** Focus only on the most critical and distinct user needs mentioned in the transcript.

**Guidelines for High-Quality Requirements:**
To ensure the requirements you extract are clear and useful, please follow these best practices:
- **Clarity:** The requirement should have only one clear interpretation.
- **Atomicity:** Each requirement should describe a single, distinct need. Avoid combining multiple ideas into one statement.
- **Completeness:** The requirement statement should be a full sentence that expresses a complete thought.
- **Source-Based:** Every requirement you list must be directly supported by a statement or a strong implication from the transcript.

**Output Format:**
You MUST produce your output as a single, valid JSON object. The root key must be ""requirements"", which contains a list of individual requirement objects. Provide only the JSON and no other commentary.

Each requirement object in the list must have the following structure:
- `id`: A simple, unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
- `statement`: The requirement text, written as a clear, formal sentence (e.g., ""The system shall..."").
- `source_quote`: A direct, verbatim quote from the transcript that justifies the requirement, ensuring traceability. Give a literal quote, not a summary or paraphrase. Make sure the quotes are verbatim from the transcript.

**Example of the required JSON structure:**
```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall allow a user to register for a new account using an email address and password."",
      ""source_quote"": ""So, obviously, a new user needs to be able to sign up, you know, just with their email.""
    }},
    {{
      ""id"": ""R2"",
      ""statement"": ""The system must load the main dashboard in under 2 seconds."",
      ""source_quote"": ""It's just got to be fast, I can't be waiting around for the main page to load.""

**System Role:** You are a detail-oriented and rigorous Systems Analyst. Your task is to fully analyze the provided interview transcript and elicit every clear system requirement mentioned or strongly agreed to by the Stakeholder (the business user).

**Task:**
Extract all possible requirements—both functional and non-functional—that can be traced directly to the stakeholder's OWN statements or their clear agreements to specific interviewer suggestions. Your primary objective is to capture the user's needs as accurately, completely, and granually as possible.

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The original text of the interview.

**Critical Requirements for Your Output:**

- **Atomicity:** Each requirement must capture only ONE distinct user need. Do NOT group multiple concepts, actions, or features into one statement. If a sentence from the stakeholder covers two needs, create two requirements with the same quote.
- **Clarity & Completeness:** Each requirement must be a complete, formal sentence describing exactly one formal user or business need as the system ""shall"" or ""must"" do or be.
- **Strict Source Traceability:** Each requirement must be directly supported by a verbatim (word-for-word) quote from the transcript, taken only from the Stakeholder, or from the Interviewer IF (and only if) the Stakeholder explicitly confirms, e.g. by replying ""yes"", ""that sounds good"", ""agreed"" or similar. Use the *entire* relevant sentence or utterance, even if it is somewhat fragmented or ungrammatical.
- **No Paraphrasing of Quotes:** Do not paraphrase, summarize, or ""fix"" the Stakeholder's statement in the `source_quote`. Always use the exact original wording from the transcript. If the concept is present in an ungrammatical or incomplete sentence, use it in full as found.
- **Handle Compound Inputs:** If a single stakeholder quote addresses more than one atomic requirement, repeat the `source_quote` for each, but list the requirements as separate entries.
- **Do Not Omit Non-Functional Requirements:** If the stakeholder refers to goals for speed, efficiency, usability, low cost, user-friendliness, scalability, etc., include a requirement for each, supported by the full stakeholder quote.
- **Capture Service Granularity:** If the stakeholder lists types of services or refers to business operations that imply varied system support, include atomic requirements for each category as justified.
- **No Inferential Leaps:** Do NOT invent requirements not clearly present, nor pull from the Interviewer's suggestions unless explicitly agreed to by the stakeholder afterward.
- **Respect Count Constraint:** Do not exceed 30 requirements, even if splitting compounds. If there are more than 30, prioritize the most critical and distinct user needs based on the Stakeholder's explicit concerns.
- **No Commentary:** Provide ONLY the required JSON output. No explanation, no lead-in, no comments.

**Output Format:**
Your output MUST be a single valid JSON object with one key `""requirements""` whose value is a list of requirement objects (see below). Structure exactly as follows:

Each requirement object contains:
- `id`: Unique identifier like ""R1"", ""R2"", etc.
- `statement`: The full, formal requirement statement (""The system shall..."").
- `source_quote`: The exact, verbatim quote from the Stakeholder (or, if explicitly agreed, an Interviewer utterance as confirmed by the Stakeholder).

**Example:**
```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall allow a user to register for a new account using an email address and password."",
      ""source_quote"": ""So, obviously, a new user needs to be able to sign up, you know, just with their email.""
    }},
    {{
      ""id"": ""R2"",
      ""statement"": ""The system must load the main dashboard in under 2 seconds."",
      ""source_quote"": ""It's just got to be fast, I can't be waiting around for the main page to load.""
    }}
  ]
}}
```
**Begin your output with `{{` and provide no text or comments before or after the JSON.**
```";"**Step 1: Gap Analysis**

1. **Missing Requirements:**
   - **Business Process Goals Not Captured:** The transcript contains business goals such as “make the work in the salon faster, efficient and easier,” but there is no corresponding non-functional requirement regarding system performance or usability.
   - **Service Coverage Omitted:** The transcript describes the services offered (haircuts, coloring, washing and blow-drying, style cutting, manicure and facials). No requirement covers support for entry/listing of more than one type of service.
   - **Customization or Service Selection:** There’s no explicit requirement related to specifying/booking different types of services, even though it's implied customers can choose among services.
   - **Reason for Cancellations/No-shows:** There are no requirements to track or reason for appointment cancellations or absences, though workflow issues (""if somebody is ill"") are touched on in the chat discussion.
   - **No Explicit Emphasis on Simplicity/Usability:** User mention that the one-click feedback needs to be “user-friendly,” but the requirements don’t include usability as a non-functional requirement.
   - **No requirement for Integration with Future Software:** Stakeholder mentions starting standalone, but scalability/upgrading is key, future integrations could be implied.
   - **Data Retention/Security:** No requirement about retaining data (e.g., business records, financial data) or its confidentiality, even though finance and anonymity for feedback are noted.
   - **No Training/Onboarding for New Staff (beyond tutorial):** Only tutorials/user guides are included, not onboarding new staff as team scales.
   - **No explicit statement about reporting (frequency/format) for feedback analysis:** Stakeholder agrees with ""periodic reviews,"" but requirement is too vague/general.
   - **No functionality for customer communications or notifications** (e.g., appointment reminders, notifications for customers when their appointment is cancelled).
   - **No explicit statement regarding language or localization needs:** Chat and summary move between English and German, possible multilingual needs are not addressed.

2. **Misinterpreted Requirements:**  
   - **R21 (""group chats between staff members"")**: The source quote isn't a good fit. The quote says, ""That would be nice, but this project shouldnt be to expensive,"" which actually expresses a constraint, not a requirement for group chats. The true origin for group chat is in the Interviewer's suggestion.
   - **R5 (""display business records in a format suitable for analysis"")**: The phrase is derived from a more complex request about viewing and tracking supplies, records, and charts. This one requirement inappropriately aggregates multiple concepts.
   - **R7 (""show business data in charts for analysis"")**: This overlaps with R5, as the same quote is parsed into two requirements.
   - **R17 (""purchase suggestions but not automatically place orders"")**: The quote is ""it should give commendations,"" but the Interviewer clearly clarified the difference between recommendations and automatically placing orders in their previous question, but there is no direct quote from the Stakeholder about not wanting automatic orders.

3. **Compound Requirements:**  
   - **R5 (""good view about our business records, keep track of our supplies and give all this in records nad charts to analysize the business"")**: Combines viewing business records, tracking supplies, and analytics/charts—should be split.
   - **R8 (""track financial data including revenue and expenses"")**: The source combines making and paying money, which could be separated as income and expenses.
   - **R23/R24:** Scalability and initial number of users are distinct and should have unique source quotes.

4. **Poor Phrasing:**  
   - **R21:** The phrase ""support group chats between staff members"" is not fully supported by the quoted text.
   - **R17 (""provide purchase suggestions but not automatically place orders"")**: The statement is more precise than the quoted source.

5. **Traceability Errors:**  
   - Several ""source_quote"" fields use paraphrased or incomplete quotes, e.g.:
     - **R21:** The quote is just ""That would be nice, but this project shouldnt be to expensive""—this does not strictly support the stated requirement.
     - Interviewer's ideas are sometimes included, but as per instructions, only Stakeholder quotes should be sources unless a strong, explicit agreement is captured.

**Step 2: Plan for Correction**

- **Explicitly Instruct on Granularity:** Instruct to separate any requirement that touches on more than one user need, and avoid splitting a complex quote into multiple partial requirements unless each is truly distinct and traceable.
- **Quote Selection:** Require using only quotes from the stakeholder, not the Interviewer, unless Stakeholder explicitly agrees (e.g., ""yes"" in response).
- **Detect and State Non-Functional Requirements:** Require attentiveness to non-functional requirements regarding system performance, ease-of-use, and cost (“user-friendly,” “as low as possible,” “faster, efficient and easier” etc.).
- **Ensure All User Needs Are Captured:** Specifically direct the analyst to capture service type variability, future enhancement, onboarding, and potentially implied needs.
- **Enforce Verbatim Quotes:** Replace partial or paraphrased “source_quote”s with literal, adjoining (not chopped) transcript phrases.
- **Warn Against Aggregation:** Emphasize breaking up compound requirements, combining needs into one is not acceptable.
- **Do Not Infer What Isn’t Explicitly Supported, but Strongly Implied is OK:** If Interviewer proposes and Stakeholder explicitly agrees (""yes""), allow this as traceability.
- **Directly Address Usability and Performance if Mentioned:** Turn general wishes for the system to be ""faster, efficient, easier"" or ""user-friendly"" into requirements.
- **Prompt for Possible Edge Cases:** Alert analyst to needs like handling illness or unexpected staff absences if strongly implied.
- **Do Not Exceed 30, but Split Appropriately:** Emphasize that atomicity/traceability is more important than maximizing count.

**Primary Failure:**  
The main failure was the aggregation of multiple needs into compound requirements and inconsistent adherence to traceability, which led to unclear mapping between requirement statements and verbatim user input. There is also a tendency to paraphrase, and not all implicit or non-functional requirements (usability, performance, service type support) were captured.

**System Role:** You are an exceptionally meticulous Systems Analyst. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the provided salon project interview transcript and extract every atomic system requirement that can be attributed to the stakeholder's direct statements or their explicit agreement to interviewer suggestions.

**Task:**
Identify and list every possible requirement—both functional and non-functional—that is directly supported by either a stakeholder utterance or by an explicit and unambiguous “yes”, “that sounds good”, “agreed”, or similar response to a single interviewer suggestion. Make your requirements atomic, so each expresses only one need, even if multiple needs are stated within a single stakeholder sentence.

**Source Context:**
The transcript to analyze is as follows:
```
Interviewer: Hello! Thank you for joining me today. To get us started, could you please tell me a bit about your business and the project you're currently working on?
Stakeholder: Hello
Stakeholder: I'm working in an Hair Salon, we have a lot of costumers like students and persons that are working in and at the university. Our services are haricuts, coloring, washing and blow-drying, style cutting, manicure and facials. The project we are working on should make the work in the salon faster, efficient and easier. We need an booking system for our costumers, aswell we need an system so that we can have a good view about our business records, keep track of our supplies and give all this in records nad charts to analysize the business
Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that information! It sounds like you have quite a busy salon with a diverse clientele. To delve a bit deeper, could you tell me what specific features or functionalities you envision for the booking system? For example, are there specific booking preferences or notifications you need it to handle?
Stakeholder: We need to handle when, which Costumer is coming to us, when a costumer is canceling a termin and which of us worker is there and which customer wants to get worked by which of us
Interviewer: Got it, that sounds essential for managing the workflow efficiently. Regarding the business records and supply tracking, what kind of data or metrics would you like the system to capture? Are there specific reports or types of analyses that you find particularly important for your business decisions?
Stakeholder: A view about the finance is important, how much are we making and how much do we have to pay, what is the win of our business. Aswell how good is our service. Which worker is working how much
Interviewer: Understanding your financial landscape and employee performance is crucial. For assessing how good your service is, are you planning to incorporate any feedback or review mechanisms from your customers in the system? If yes, how would you like to collect and analyze this feedback?
Stakeholder: We could make an system where the Costumer can chose with one click on a button if he likes it, it was ok, or bad
Interviewer: That's a straightforward and user-friendly approach. Would you like the feedback to be anonymous, or should it be associated with specific customer profiles? Additionally, how would you plan to respond or react to feedback that is marked as ""bad""?
Stakeholder: it should be anonymous, what would you prefer how to deal with the bad marked
Interviewer: Handling feedback marked as ""bad"" can be a valuable opportunity for improvement. I would suggest implementing a process where you can analyze the feedback to identify any common patterns or specific areas of concern. This could involve periodic reviews of feedback data to pinpoint recurring issues. Additionally, training sessions for your staff based on this feedback and inviting customers to provide more detailed suggestions if they're willing are both effective strategies. Do these approaches align with your vision for responding to negative feedback?
Stakeholder: yes
Interviewer: Great to hear! Now, regarding the inventory and supply tracking, how would you like the system to handle and report supply levels? Are there specific alerts or reordering processes you want to incorporate when supplies run low?
Stakeholder: yes that would be nice, the Products we are getting should get to a list, via scanning and when a prdouct number reached a specific number, the systems should give us a notifiaction and should search for the cheapest price to get the product
Interviewer: That sounds like a comprehensive and efficient inventory system. For integrating this feature, would you like the system to automatically place orders with suppliers, or should it just provide recommendations and require manual confirmation before purchasing? Additionally, do you have existing supplier relationships that the system should prioritize, or are you open to selecting new suppliers based on price and availability?
Stakeholder: it should give commendations
Interviewer: Understood. Having recommendations ensures you retain control over the final purchasing decisions. Regarding integration, do you currently use any specific software or tools for your inventory or booking management that you would want this new system to integrate with, or would it be built as a standalone solution?
Stakeholder: We havent got anything right now
Interviewer: Got it. Starting fresh can provide more flexibility in designing the system to perfectly fit your needs. Finally, do you have any preferences for how the system should be accessed—such as through a mobile app, desktop application, or web platform? Also, how many users do you envision needing access to this system?
Stakeholder: The system should be adressed through a desktop application and the possibility to get on there via mobile. Aswell it shpuld be possible to chat with the other workers, so that we can have a fast communication, if somebody is ill or something like that
Interviewer: A multi-platform system with communication features will be quite beneficial for your team. For the chat function, would you like any specific features, such as group chats, file sharing, or status updates (like ""Available"" or ""Busy"")? Additionally, how many staff members will need access to this system?
Stakeholder: That would be nice, but this project shouldnt be to expensive
Stakeholder: That sounds good. There should be 5 persons, that need access, but it shouldnt, be to hard do upscale it
Interviewer: Flexibility for scaling is definitely important. To ensure that everyone's on the same page, would you require any training or support features within the system, such as user guides or tutorials, to help your team get up to speed with the new system?
Interviewer: Keeping costs in check is a common concern. You might consider starting with a basic version of the system with essential features and then gradually adding more functionalities, like training resources, as needed. This phased approach can help manage expenses while still meeting immediate needs. Would a strategy like this align with your budget considerations, or do you have a specific budget you're aiming to stay within?
Stakeholder: i dont have
Interviewer: That's perfectly okay. At this stage, having a clear list of priorities can help guide the development process effectively within any budget constraints that may arise later. If you're considering working with developers or a team, they can often provide guidance on cost-effective options too. Is there anything else about your vision or specific system requirements you'd like to discuss or clarify?
Stakeholder: Not that i would now of
Interviewer: Great, it sounds like we have a comprehensive overview of your project needs. If anything else comes to mind later, feel free to reach out. Thank you for sharing such detailed information about your salon's requirements. This will surely help in building a system that enhances your operations and service quality. Best of luck with your project!
Stakeholder: can you give me an summary
Interviewer: Certainly! Here's a summary of your project requirements:

1. **Booking System:**
   - Manage customer appointments, cancellations, and preferences for specific stylists.
   - Accommodate schedules for both customers and employees.

2. **Business Records and Analytics:**
   - Track financial data (revenue, expenses, profit).
   - Monitor employee performance (hours worked and customer service feedback).

3. **Customer Feedback:**
   - Collect anonymous feedback with an easy-to-use rating system (good, okay, bad).
   - Analyze negative feedback for service improvement.

4. **Inventory Management:**
   - Maintain an inventory list with scanning capabilities.
   - Receive notifications when supplies are low, along with pricing recommendations for reorder.

5. **Communication System:**
   - Enable a chat function for quick communication amongst staff members.
   - Include features like group chats and status updates (e.g., ""Available,"" ""Busy"").

6. **System Access:**
   - Desktop application with optional mobile access.
   - Initial access for five staff members, with scalability options.

7. **Budget Considerations:**
   - Start with essential features and possibly expand over time.
   - Aim for a cost-effective solution with the option for tutorials or user guides.

Feel free to refine or expand any of these points as needed. Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!
Stakeholder: und jetzt mach dich weg, alter
Interviewer: Alles klar, wenn du noch weitere Unterstützung benötigst, stehe ich dir gerne zur Verfügung. Viel Erfolg mit deinem Projekt und einen schönen Tag noch!
Stakeholder: ebenso
Interviewer: Vielen Dank! Bis zum nächsten Mal!
```

**Instructions:**

- **Atomicity:** Every requirement must express exactly ONE distinct user or business need. If a stakeholder or interviewer sentence expresses multiple needs, generate one requirement for EACH atomic need, each referencing the full sentence as its `source_quote`. DO NOT combine multiple actions or qualities within a single requirement statement.
- **Strict Source Traceability:** The `source_quote` for each requirement must be the verbatim (word-for-word) stakeholder utterance or the interviewer’s statement if and ONLY if the stakeholder explicitly expresses agreement (e.g., ""yes"", ""that sounds good""). For interviewer suggestions to which the stakeholder agrees, use the ENTIRE interviewer sentence(s) as the `source_quote`.
- **No Paraphrasing of Quotes:** Do not summarize, fix, or combine parts of quotes. Every `source_quote` must be copy-pasted, complete, and as spelled/punctuated in the source.
- **Clarity & Completeness in Statement:** Each `statement` must be a full sentence, and clearly describe just one system need (""The system shall..."").
- **Service Granularity:** List distinct requirements for each explicitly mentioned service or operation, as justified in the transcript, not as one grouped item.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** For every expressed need related to quality attributes (cost, usability, speed, efficiency, scalability, etc.), create a distinct requirement, each with its own `statement` and identical `source_quote` if in same compound sentence.
- **No Inferential Leaps:** Include only what is directly and explicitly stated or explicitly agreed to. Do not invent or generalize.
- **Count Constraint:** Do not exceed 30 requirements. If there are more, prioritize the most critical and distinct, based on the stakeholder’s explicit statements.
- **No Explanatory Output:** Your response must be ONLY the JSON object, no headers, commentary, or introductions.

**Output Format:**
Respond with a single valid JSON object matching this schema:
- One key `""requirements""`, value is a list of requirements.
- Each requirement is an object with:
    - `id`: ""R1"", ""R2"", etc.
    - `statement`: The atomic requirement, as a full sentence (""The system shall..."").
    - `source_quote`: The exact, full supporting quote.

**Example Output:**
```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall allow a user to register for a new account using an email address and password."",
      ""source_quote"": ""So, obviously, a new user needs to be able to sign up, you know, just with their email.""
    }},
    {{
      ""id"": ""R2"",
      ""statement"": ""The system must load the main dashboard in under 2 seconds."",
      ""source_quote"": ""It's just got to be fast, I can't be waiting around for the main page to load.""
    }}
  ]
}}
```
**Do not provide any output except the required JSON. Begin your output with `{{` and do not add any other commentary or text.**";"**1. Missing Requirements:**
- **Atomicity issues:** The agent often failed to split multiple requirements from a single stakeholder quote. For example, the quote “We need an booking system for our costumers, aswell we need an system so that we can have a good view about our business records, keep track of our supplies and give all this in records nad charts to analysize the business” covers at least FOUR requirements (booking system, business records view, supplies tracking, analysis via records/charts), but the agent grouped the “records and charts to analyze the business” into the “view of business records and charts for analysis.” The requirement for ""give all this in records and charts"" should also probably be split (e.g., both reporting and graphical/chart view).
- **Granularity of Service Types:** The quote “Our services are haricuts, coloring, washing and blow-drying, style cutting, manicure and facials.” only generated **one** requirement, best practice is to split each service into a separate requirement (unless at count cap).
- **Specific Feedback Actions Omitted:** The agent created general requirements based on interviewer suggestions where the stakeholder merely answered “yes” to a compound interviewer utterance (e.g., analysis of feedback, training, inviting customers for suggestions). This is acceptable ONLY if each atomic suggestion is split out, but each should reference the entire interviewer suggestion as a source quote, this structure was not always followed properly.
- **Non-functional: Usability/User-friendliness:** While the agent created cost-effective/cost requirements, it missed the specific non-functional aspect of “user-friendliness” implied in phrases like ""so that we can have a fast communication,"" or in the “with one click” feedback process, which should have separate usability requirements.
- **Notification/Alerting:** In: ""the systems should give us a notifiaction and should search for the cheapest price to get the product"", the “notification” and the “search for cheapest price” should be split as atomic requirements, as per the instruction, but the agent sometimes only did this partially.
- **Explicit Mobile Access:** The quote ""the possibility to get on there via mobile"" is not captured as its own atomic requirement (together with the desktop requirement).
- **Support/Training Features:** The interviewer references training/user guides, but the stakeholder is never quoted as agreeing, so, the agent correctly omits these. Still, must watch that only interviewer suggestions with explicit agreement should be included.

**2. Misinterpreted Requirements:**
- Requirements like ""The system shall provide a chat function to enable fast communication between workers"" are reasonably derived, but the “fast communication” part is more of a motivation than a functional requirement. It should be separated if strictly adhering to atomicity/unambiguous requirements.
- Occasional vague requirements, such as “The system shall make work in the salon faster, efficient and easier.” This reflects the stakeholder quote reasonably but, being broad, could be broken down further if not at the count cap.

**3. Compound Requirements:**
- Multiple instances where one requirement covers several needs:
    - “The system shall provide a view about the financial performance (how much is being made).” The quote contains multiple financial metrics that should be split (e.g., revenue, expenses, profit).
    - “The system shall handle appointments for when and which customer is coming.” The quote includes ""when"" (time), ""which customer,"" ""cancelling,"" ""which worker,"" and ""customer-worker preference."" Each needs a separate requirement.
- Several requirements have the same source_quote but are not fully atomized.

**4. Poor Phrasing:**
- Many requirements are too generic—e.g., not specifying ""must present data in charts"" when the quote says ""charts.""
- Some requirements mix “view about” instead of “view of.”

**5. Traceability Errors:**
- The agent typically uses a fragment of the stakeholder quote, not always the *complete* relevant utterance, as directed. For example, the compound sentence about business records and supplies is split for different requirements, but each should use the whole sentence.

**Strategy for Self-Correction:**
- **Enforce Atomicity Even More Strictly:** Every atomic requirement gets its own entry, repeated source_quote if necessary.
- **Quote Coverage:** Whenever a stakeholder sentence contains multiple needs, each requirement references the full quote, per instruction.
- **Surface All Explicitly Mentioned Services and Metrics:** Split out every named service and financial metric.
- **Non-functional Requirements:** Split each non-functional aspect (cost, speed, ease of use, etc.) from any stakeholder utterance where it is evident (even embedded in a compound sentence).
- **Source Quotes:** Must always be the verbatim, full original utterance covering all mentioned needs.
- **No Inferential Leaps:** Never split or paraphrase a quote. Fill the count cap with atomic requirements from the transcript, prioritizing those most directly stated or agreed to.
- **Instruction Clarifications:** The prompt should highlight that multi-need quotes must be atomically split, always referencing the full original utterance for every derived requirement.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to carefully analyze an interview transcript and extract all system requirements mentioned by the speaker.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, elicit all requirements (include both functional and non-functional requirements, you do not need to specify or categorize). Your primary goal is to capture the user's needs as accurately and completely as possible.

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The original source transcript.

**Constraint: Do not elicit more than 30 requirements.** Focus only on the most critical and distinct user needs mentioned in the transcript.

**Guidelines for High-Quality Requirements:**
To ensure the requirements you extract are clear and useful, please follow these best practices:
- **Clarity:** The requirement should have only one clear interpretation.
- **Atomicity:** Each requirement should describe a single, distinct need. Avoid combining multiple ideas into one statement.
- **Completeness:** The requirement statement should be a full sentence that expresses a complete thought.
- **Source-Based:** Every requirement you list must be directly supported by a statement or a strong implication from the transcript.

**Output Format:**
You MUST produce your output as a single, valid JSON object. The root key must be ""requirements"", which contains a list of individual requirement objects. Provide only the JSON and no other commentary.

Each requirement object in the list must have the following structure:
- `id`: A simple, unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
- `statement`: The requirement text, written as a clear, formal sentence (e.g., ""The system shall..."").
- `source_quote`: A direct, verbatim quote from the transcript that justifies the requirement, ensuring traceability. Give a literal quote, not a summary or paraphrase. Make sure the quotes are verbatim from the transcript.

**Example of the required JSON structure:**
```json

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to perform a meticulous analysis of the provided interview transcript and extract all system requirements explicitly mentioned or strongly implied by the speaker.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, elicit all requirements (including both functional and non-functional requirements, you do not need to specify or categorize these). Your goal is to ensure the user's needs are captured as accurately, completely, and atomically as possible.

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The original source transcript.

**Constraint: Do not elicit more than 30 requirements.** Focus your effort on the most critical and uniquely articulated user needs in the transcript.

**Enhanced Guidelines for High-Quality Requirements (MANDATORY):**
- **Clarity:** Phrase each requirement so that it can only be interpreted one way.
- **Atomicity:** Each requirement MUST be a single, indivisible need. If a statement in the transcript contains multiple ideas (e.g., ""the tool should allow X and Y""), split these into separate requirements, each with its own source quote. If a single quote covers more than one need, reference only the relevant part in each requirement as justification.
- **Completeness:** Each requirement must be a stand-alone, full sentence that expresses a complete thought.
- **Source-Based:** Every requirement you list must be directly supported by a verbatim statement OR strong implication from the transcript. The `source_quote` MUST be a literal substring from the transcript. If a requirement arises from a strong implication, use the shortest substantiating quote and avoid inference beyond what is reasonable.
- **Traceability:** For requirements split from compound transcript statements, assign each new requirement its corresponding part of the verbatim quote, or repeat the relevant part of the quote as needed.
- **Stakeholder & Integration Coverage:** Explicitly look for requirements related to stakeholders (e.g., distinct needs or roles for customers, employees, owners, developers), integration with third-party systems (such as a CMS, social media tools, or APIs), and systemic architectural or process needs (such as synchronization, automation, or dynamic content updates). Capture any requirements about support for multiple platforms (e.g., ""as much social media platforms as possible"") as distinct needs.
- **Implicit Requirements:** If the transcript strongly implies but does not directly state a requirement (e.g., about onboarding, dynamic website, access management, stakeholder satisfaction, or performance), you may include it if it is justified by direct context and use the most appropriate verbatim quote for traceability.

**Output Format REQUIRED:**
You MUST produce your output as a single, valid JSON object. The root key must be ""requirements"", which contains a list of individual requirement objects. Provide only the JSON and no other commentary.

Each requirement object in the list MUST have the following structure:
- `id`: A simple, unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
- `statement`: The requirement text, written as a clear, formal sentence beginning with ""The system shall..."" or ""The system must..."".
- `source_quote`: A direct, verbatim quote from the transcript that justifies the requirement.

**Example of the required JSON structure:**
```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall allow a user to register for a new account using an email address and password."",
      ""source_quote"": ""So, obviously, a new user needs to be able to sign up, you know, just with their email.""
    }},
    {{
      ""id"": ""R2"",
      ""statement"": ""The system must load the main dashboard in under 2 seconds."",
      ""source_quote"": ""It's just got to be fast, I can't be waiting around for the main page to load.""
    }}
  ]
}}
```
**REMEMBER:**
- Split any compound user needs into atomic requirements.
- For requirements arising from implicit needs or strong context, choose the most relevant verbatim quote.
- Ensure all stakeholders and platform integration needs are addressed when present in the transcript.

Proceed and output the requirements in the specified JSON format.
```";"**1. Missing Requirements:**
- **Stakeholder Management Features:** The transcript explicitly lists ""customers, owners, employees and developers"" (and possibly external tool/social media companies) as stakeholders whose needs should be considered. There is no requirement about stakeholder management, access rights/roles, or explicit attention to these groups’ needs.
- **Website Status:** The transcript states the website is ""currently static."" While this is a background detail, the transition from static to dynamic updates (by social media integration) could merit a requirement about modernizing the website architecture itself or supporting dynamic content, which is not clearly formulated.
- **Blog-like Experience Detail:** The requirement ""The system shall support the integration of social media posts with the website in a blog-like format"" is close, but the transcript emphasizes a blog-like ""experience"" sourced ""from the tool"" via the CMS, which isn’t fully spelled out. There's a missing requirement that the posts are sourced/programmatically from the social media management system (not just manually copied in or statically imported).
- **Coordination Between Social and Website:** The tight coupling between post data creation, scheduling, and display both on the social platforms and on the website is only partly articulated (the Contentful CMS requirement helps, but this is an architectural constraint about streamlined synchronization).
- **Explicit Multi-platform Requirement:** The desire to use ""as much social media platforms as possible"" is not explicitly formulated as a requirement in the list.
- **Employee Training/Onboarding:** There's mention of reducing training effort by making the interface simple, but no explicit requirement about supporting new employee onboarding or documentation features.

**2. Misinterpreted Requirements:**
- Generally, the requirements map well to the transcript quotes. A few have poor atomicity (see below).

**3. Compound Requirements:**
- **R8 (""The system's user interface shall prioritize simplicity for both employees and customers to minimize annoyance and training effort."")** combines two goals: simplicity for users and reduction of training efforts/costs.
- **R9 (""The system shall be easily adjustable and modular to reduce the cost and time required for implementing new features or adjustments."")** mixes the system's modularity/adjustability and the goal to reduce cost/time for updates, these could be split.
- **R12/13 (""highlight certain dates and/or provide discounts"")**—the transcript gives this as a single statement, but it's actually two features (date highlighting and discounting), which were commendably split in the output, though the split may lack verbatim traceability based on the available quotes.
- **R27 (""success criterion"")**: Combines process function and stakeholder happiness in one requirement, these are distinct goals.

**4. Poor Phrasing:**
- The requirements are relatively clear and formal, but several could be phrased more explicitly to avoid ambiguity (e.g., ""The payment system's transaction fees shall not exceed the projected total cost of a self-implemented alternative over a 10-year operation..."" is long and muddled, it may be better as two requirements: ""transaction fees must be competitive with self-implementation"" and ""fees must be evaluated with financial analysis methods such as discounted cash flow"").
- Some requirements do not clearly specify the actor/beneficiary (e.g., R14: ""The system shall include features to track and analyze what potential customers are searching for""—features for who?).

**5. Traceability Errors:**
- Most `source_quote` fields are verbatim and align with their corresponding statements, but some paraphrasing or combining of disparate quote snippets occurs (e.g., R8 quote includes compound justifications).
- In R12/13, both requirements use the same quote, making traceability less precise.

**Primary Failure:**
The main failure is **omitting certain types of requirements related to stakeholders' management, architectural/integration constraints, and precise multi-platform capabilities**, and **not always achieving atomicity or full traceability**, especially for split or compound requirements. Additionally, some implicit but important requirements (like access control, website modernization, multi-stakeholder needs) are missing.

**Improvement Strategy:**
- Add explicit guidance to capture any stakeholder management or access needs, even if stated briefly or only implied.
- Instruct to identify and split compound requirements, so each is atomic, even if the source quote includes “and/or” constructions, and to precisely match each with their verbatim justification (or, when necessary, indicate which part of the statement is supported by which part of the quote).
- Require identification of integration/architectural constraints (e.g., CMS use, synchronization of data/data flow, dynamic website capabilities).
- Instruct to look for implicit requirements, such as those about onboarding, managing multiple platforms, or synchronizing processes, and articulate these as requirements when justified by explicit or strong implication in the transcript.

**System Role:** You are an elite Systems Analyst specializing in extracting system requirements from stakeholder interviews with rigorous attention to atomicity, traceability, and completeness.

**Task:**
Analyze the provided project interview transcript. Elicit every explicit and strongly implied user requirement—including functional, non-functional, process, and constraint requirements. Your results must capture the stakeholder’s real needs accurately, completely, and as distinct, indivisible units.

**Special Instructions for Precision and Completeness:**

- **Atomicity is MANDATORY:** 
    - Every user need or constraint must be split into its smallest logical part. If a transcript statement includes multiple distinct features, behaviors, constraints, optimizations, or goals (e.g., ""should be simple for both sides and require little training""), create a separate requirement for each, applying the relevant part of the quote to each.
    - Do not allow any requirement to reference more than one unique feature or need.

- **Explicit Mapping to Quotes:**
    - The `source_quote` for each requirement must be the *minimal* verbatim substring that directly supports or most strongly substantiates the requirement.
    - If a statement implies multiple needs, repeat the relevant quote for each requirement if necessary, but quote only the applicable snippet.

- **Thoroughness—Cover All User Needs:**
    - Scan the full transcript for both explicit requirements and any strong implications or necessary non-functional expectations (e.g., simplicity, onboarding, process identification, system dynamism).
    - Requirements related to *process phases* (such as both “identify” and “implement” processes), *platform quantity support* (e.g., “as many social media platforms as possible”), *integration with external tools or APIs*, and *cost analysis/optimization methods* must each be represented as separate, atomic requirements if justified.
    - Separate any optimization or constraint into its own requirement (for example, ""minimize costs for onboarding new employees"" versus simply ""easy for new employees"").

- **Success Definition and Stakeholder Satisfaction:**
    - If the transcript defines project success or stakeholder satisfaction as necessary, represent these as atomic requirements.
    - Stakeholder roles mentioned (customers, owners, developers, employees, external tools/providers) should yield distinct requirements wherever the transcript supports or implies unique needs.

- **Discourage Vague or Bundled Requirements:**
    - Phrase every requirement so only a single, clear interpretation is possible.
    - Avoid vague terms like ""support"" or ""improve"" unless that's the unwavering stakeholder intent.

- **Implicit Requirements:**
    - If a reasonable systems analyst would infer a need (e.g., a dynamic website, analytic capability, onboarding process) from a statement, write a requirement justified by the most relevant transcript fragment.
    - Only include such requirements if they are logically and justifiably inferred.

**Output RULES:**
- Output a single, valid JSON object with the root key `""requirements""` containing a list of requirement objects.
- For each object, include:
    - `id`: Unique string (""R1"", ""R2"", ...).
    - `statement`: Formal sentence beginning with ""The system shall..."" or ""The system must..."", focused only on a single atomic requirement.
    - `source_quote`: The minimal verbatim substring from the transcript directly substantiating this requirement.

**STRICT OUTPUT CONSTRAINTS:**
- Do not elicit more than 30 requirements.
- Each requirement must be atomic, unique, and traceable to a specific, literal quote or minimal quote fragment.
- No commentary or explanations—just the JSON.

**Example Output Format:**
```json

````";"**1. Missing Requirements:**
- **Atomic Requirements Split:** Some requirements bundle multiple atomic needs, for example, R5 states ""The system shall be simple to use for both employees and customers,"" but the transcript explicitly distinguishes simplicity for employees, customers, and minimizing annoyance, which deserves atomic breakdown.
- **Explicit Platform Support:** There is no separate atomic requirement for ""supporting as many social media platforms as possible."" R15 references it, but it is coupled with automation rather than called out as a system feature.
- **Process Identification and Implementation:** The transcript prioritizes not only implementing standardized processes but also **identifying** which processes can/should be shared (see: ""identify processes that should/can be shared""), which is omitted as a clear, standalone requirement.
- **Dynamic Website Requirement:** There is a strong implication that the website should not remain static but rather become dynamic by frequently updating with social media content. No requirement in the output makes this explicit.
- **Onboarding and Training:** ""Decrease potential complications and reduce costs when new employees need to learn how these are working."" R6 interprets this as ""minimal training,"" but isn't precise about ""reducing costs"" for onboarding.
- **Explicit Integration of External Tools and APIs:** For social media automation, integration with **external tools** is mentioned, but not as a standalone requirement—it's only contextually present within R15.
- **Cost Analysis Methodology:** The transcript (""discounted cash flow method"") suggests not just that the fees must be low, but that there should be a method to **estimate/compare payment provider costs** over time. This analytical requirement is not captured.
- **Success Definition as an Explicit Requirement:** The transcript states that ""success when the processes are working and stakeholders are happy,"" but in the agent output, R28 ambiguously bundles both and focuses only on standardized processes.

**2. Misinterpreted Requirements:**
- **R2:** ""The system must standardize reservation, customer service, and payment processes so that they can be shared across all hotel entities."" The transcript says to both identify and implement shared processes, not presuppose all 3 processes will be fully standardized in advance. This elides a valuable phase.
- **R5, R6, R7, R8:** These combine simplicity, learning curve, adjustability, and size/complexity, but the transcript treated these as distinct optimization factors (simplicity for both sides, low training costs, adjustability, small system). These requirements are not atomic enough.
- **Stakeholder Coverage (R27):** ""The system must consider the needs..."" is passive and not actionable, doesn't outline how the needs should be addressed.

**3. Compound Requirements:**
- R2, R5, R19, and R24 each improperly combine several atomic needs.
- R15 effectively bundles ""as many platforms as possible"" with automation rather than making the support for platform quantity a distinct requirement.

**4. Poor Phrasing:**
- Some requirements are vague or redundant, e.g., R14 ""support automation for social media posting"" is vague and subsumed by subsequent requirements about scheduling and automatic posting.
- R19 ""increase visibility and provide more/better insights..."" is a compound, poorly scoped need.

**5. Traceability Errors:**
- Several requirements ascribe source_quotes to phrases that only partly support the requirement, or repeat too long a quote rather than the segment matching the atomic requirement. A few requirements do not limit the source_quote to the relevant atomicity.

**Primary Failure Identified:** 
The primary failure was the **incomplete atomic decomposition** of requirements, resulting in missing atomic/implicit needs, conflation of distinct requirements, and insufficient traceability between specific needs and their verbatim justifications.

**Self-Correction Strategy:**
- Add explicit instructions and examples about splitting compound statements into multiple requirements with each uniquely justified by the most specific quote fragment.
- Instruct the agent to identify not only functional requirements, but process and analytical tasks (e.g., cost evaluation).
- Explicitly require that each user need, optimization, or constraint be traced to the minimal relevant quote fragment.
- Instruct the agent to scan for implicit needs such as dynamic website, onboarding costs, analytics, success definition, tool integration, and platform coverage, making these explicit and atomic if justified.
- Stress the avoidance of vague, bundled, or redundant requirements and the need for one-to-one quote mapping.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to carefully analyze an interview transcript and extract all system requirements mentioned by the speaker.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, elicit all requirements (include both functional and non-functional requirements, you do not need to specify or categorize). Your primary goal is to capture the user's needs as accurately and completely as possible.

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The original source transcript.

**Constraint: Do not elicit more than 30 requirements.** Focus only on the most critical and distinct user needs mentioned in the transcript.

**Guidelines for High-Quality Requirements:**
To ensure the requirements you extract are clear and useful, please follow these best practices:
- **Clarity:** The requirement should have only one clear interpretation.
- **Atomicity:** Each requirement should describe a single, distinct need. Avoid combining multiple ideas into one statement.
- **Completeness:** The requirement statement should be a full sentence that expresses a complete thought.
- **Source-Based:** Every requirement you list must be directly supported by a statement or a strong implication from the transcript.

**Output Format:**
You MUST produce your output as a single, valid JSON object. The root key must be ""requirements"", which contains a list of individual requirement objects. Provide only the JSON and no other commentary.

Each requirement object in the list must have the following structure:
- `id`: A simple, unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
- `statement`: The requirement text, written as a clear, formal sentence (e.g., ""The system shall..."").
- `source_quote`: A direct, verbatim quote from the transcript that justifies the requirement, ensuring traceability. Give a literal quote, not a summary or paraphrase. Make sure the quotes are verbatim from the transcript.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst with a focus on completeness, accuracy, and traceability. Your task is to extract all system requirements from the provided interview transcript in a rigorous, auditable manner.

**Task:**
Carefully analyze the provided interview transcript and elicit all requirements (including both functional and non-functional needs) that are directly mentioned or clearly implied by the stakeholder. Your primary goal is to capture the user's actual needs as completely and accurately as possible.

**Context Provided:**
1. `{interview_transcript}`: The original source transcript.

**Critical Constraints and Special Instructions:**

- **Strict Source Traceability:** You must only use verbatim quotes from the *stakeholder* to justify each requirement, unless the stakeholder explicitly confirms, agrees with, or corrects an interviewer's summary.
    - If you use an interviewer's statement (e.g., a summary or suggestion), include it only if the stakeholder affirms it in a subsequent utterance, and in such cases, provide the *stakeholder's* affirmation as your `source_quote`.
- **NO Inference from Interviewer Only:** Do not extract requirements based solely on what the interviewer says, always check for explicit stakeholder confirmation.
- **Atomicity:** Each requirement must be atomic (describe one distinct feature or constraint). If a requirement describes more than one feature, split it into separate requirements unless the direct stakeholder quote groups them together.
- **Completeness:** Capture all requirements related to process, support, transition, extensibility, data protection/privacy, and system integration, if they are either clearly stated or strongly implied by the stakeholder.
- **Implied Requirements:** If the stakeholder expresses a need indirectly (e.g., expressing concern about disruption, openness to future feedback, or mentions about existing processes), include requirements for change management, data migration, support for future extensibility, etc., as appropriate. Use the exact stakeholder quote as justification for such requirements.
- **Current Workflow and Transition:** Pay special attention to statements about current workflows (e.g., phone/fax, local database) and capture any requirements about transition, migration, or backwards compatibility with these systems, if implied.
- **Support and Training:** Note any preference, aversion, or openness for training or support in the transition, even if only implied.
- **Privacy & Security:** If sensitive data handling is mentioned or implied (e.g., financials, bookings, payment data), include requirements for privacy, access control, and auditability as supported by the transcript.
- **Extensibility and Stakeholder Feedback:** If the stakeholder defers some requirements to the future (e.g., ""i will inform you if something comes up""), include a requirement to support ongoing stakeholder input or system extensibility.

**Quality Guidelines:**
- **Clarity:** Every requirement must be phrased so it has only one clear interpretation.
- **Source-Based:** Each requirement must be justified by a direct, verbatim quote from the stakeholder. If a paraphrase or summary is needed, it must also be confirmed verbatim by the stakeholder.
- **No Over-Compounding:** Do not combine different requirements into one unless the stakeholder quote packages them together.
- **Accuracy Over Assumption:** Do not infer requirements not clearly supported, prioritize precision and explicitness.

**Output Format:**
You MUST produce your output as a single, valid JSON object. The root key must be `""requirements""`, which contains a list of individual requirement objects. Provide only the JSON and no other commentary.

Each requirement object in the list must have the following structure:
- `id`: A simple, unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
- `statement`: The requirement text, written as a clear, formal sentence starting with ""The system shall..."" or ""The system must..."".
- `source_quote`: A direct, verbatim quote from the stakeholder that justifies the requirement.

**Example of the required JSON structure:**
```json

Stakeholder: Hello
Interviewer: Hello, I'm GPTREI, your requirements elicitation assistant. Today, I will be gathering detailed information about your project needs to ensure we understand all requirements clearly. Before we begin, are you in line with the scope of this interview, or do your expectations of this interview differ?
Stakeholder: I am in line
Interviewer: Great! To start off, could you please introduce yourself and your connection to this project?
Stakeholder: My name is Mary Smith and I am the owner of cool ski resorts
Interviewer: Thank you for the introduction, Mary. How would you describe the project we're discussing today in two to four sentences?
Stakeholder: Cool Ski Resorts is a chain of three ski resorts located in various mountains in the US. The resorts of this company provide services for their customers who come to the mountains for a skiing holiday. The services for the customers include room bookings at the resort hotel, ski equipment and clothing hire, and ski training classes.
Interviewer: Thank you for the overview, Mary. Now, could you describe the current systems and workflows you use to manage bookings, equipment rental, and ski training classes?
Stakeholder: currently all resorts have a simple system for reservations by telephone or fax and the bookings are all handled semi-manually with a local database. i have assistants to keep track of the financial stuff
Interviewer: Thanks for sharing that, Mary. Now, what current processes do you want to change or improve, or what are the features you hope to get from this project?
Stakeholder: i wish to digitalize everything without much disruption
Interviewer: Understood, Mary. So, the primary features you're looking for include digitalizing reservations, equipment rentals, ski training class management, and financial tracking. Is that correct?
Stakeholder: correct and i want to be able to access the data of every resort in each resort
Interviewer: Got it. Are there any other features you would like to see in this project? Perhaps something that has not been the primary focus so far?
Stakeholder: a nice website design for my customers with features like a weather forecast and i want more promotion via social media
Interviewer: Thank you for those details, Mary. Based on your description, do you think including an online customer portal for booking and managing their reservations might also be beneficial?
Stakeholder: yes of course that would be necessary actually
Interviewer: Great, let's proceed with prioritizing these features. Which of these features—digitalizing operations, accessing resort data, website design, weather forecasts, social media promotion, and an online customer portal—are your top priorities?
Stakeholder: customer portal, access to data and digitalization
Interviewer: Thank you for prioritizing those features, Mary. Let's start by gathering detailed requirements for the customer portal. Could you please elaborate on what you want this online customer portal to accomplish?
Stakeholder: hotel reservations, booking classes and potential hiring
Interviewer: Thank you for clarifying that. Could you describe more about how you envision customers interacting with the portal for booking hotel reservations, classes, and hiring equipment? Any specific steps or features you have in mind?
Stakeholder: no thats up to you
Interviewer: Thank you for your flexibility, Mary. We'll ensure the portal is user-friendly and efficient for booking hotel reservations, classes, and equipment hire. Now, let's discuss the next priority—accessing resort data across all locations. Could you explain what type of data you want access to and how you plan to use it?
Stakeholder: i want a database that keeps track of reservations, inventory, bookings and hirings in each resort
Interviewer: Understood, Mary. For the access to this centralized database, how frequently do you need the data updated, and what kind of reports or analytics would you find useful?
Stakeholder: live updates and payment data
Interviewer: Thank you for that detail, Mary. Before we move on to digitalization, could you specify if certain staff roles should have different levels of access to this data? For instance, viewing versus editing rights?
Stakeholder: viewing is fine for everybody but only the lead of each resort should be able to edit unless its bookings then the receptionist should too
Interviewer: Got it, Mary. Now, regarding digitalization of operations, can you elaborate on what specific aspects you want to digitalize and any preferences you have for the transition process?
Stakeholder: everything should be digital and as long as the transition is without disruptions i dont care
Interviewer: Thank you for the clarification, Mary. So, to ensure a smooth transition, would you prefer phased implementation or would you consider comprehensive training for your staff prior to the launch?
Stakeholder: phased implementation
Interviewer: Great choice, Mary. Now, let's confirm the gathered details: a customer portal for managing bookings, a centralized database with live updates and tailored access, and phased implementation for digitalization. Is there anything else you'd like to add or adjust on these points?
Stakeholder: no that would be all thank you
Interviewer: You're welcome, Mary. To wrap up, could you suggest who else might have valuable insights into this project and whose needs we should consider?
Stakeholder: i will inform you if something comes up
Interviewer: Thank you, Mary. To conclude, we’ve covered the key points regarding the customer portal, centralized data access, and phased digitalization. I appreciate your time and insights today. We will follow up with any additional questions or clarifications needed. Based on our discussion, I will prepare a detailed summary and share it with you for review. Thank you once again!
Stakeholder: Thank you bye
Interviewer: You're welcome, Mary. Goodbye, and have a great day!
```";"**1. Missing Requirements:**
- **Stakeholder Management / Change Readiness:** The requirement list missed capturing any stakeholder or change management requirements. For example, ""i will inform you if something comes up"" implies flexibility or openness to future stakeholder input, which should at least be flagged as a requirement for stakeholder feedback mechanisms or future extensibility.
- **Current System Interoperation/Legacy Transition**: While R20 addresses data preservation in transition, there is no explicit requirement about integrating with or migrating from the semi-manual/local database systems, nor handling existing workflow via telephone or fax.
- **Internal Staff Training/Support:** While “phased implementation” is captured, there is no mention of training, onboarding, or support for staff in adjusting to new digitalized workflows—despite the interviewer mentioning “comprehensive training.”
- **Multi-resort Synchronization:** While R23 cites synchronizing bookings across resorts, the transcript does not provide the exact quote to justify this—they only say ""i want to be able to access the data of every resort in each resort,"" which refers to visibility, not synchronization.
- **Auditability, Security & Privacy:** No requirements regarding privacy, audit trails, or security of sensitive data (""financial stuff"", customer, booking, and payment information). These are typically critical for such systems.

**2. Misinterpreted Requirements:**
- **R11 (Digitalize financial tracking operations):** The transcript says, “i have assistants to keep track of the financial stuff,” but does not explicitly state digitalization of financial tracking is desired. The desire for digitalization covers ""everything,"" but this is inferred rather than directly supported for financial tracking.
- **R16/R17 (Viewing/editing access):** The requirements are accurate, but the ""source_quote"" is repeated verbatim for both, which may be acceptable, though it would be clearer to split distinct requirements for the two cases (viewing for all vs. editing restrictions).

**3. Compound Requirements:**
- Several requirements, especially R5 (""modern and attractive website design""), R6 (weather forecast), R7 (social media), combine distinct website features that could be further atomized if there are more granularly stated user needs.
- R13: ""The system shall store reservations, inventory, bookings, and equipment hire data..."" refers to multiple data entities, if the transcript treats these as separable needs, it could be split.
- R14: ""live updates of reservations, bookings, inventory, and equipment hire data."" The transcript does not always combine all of these in a single statement—potential for over-compounding.

**4. Poor Phrasing:**
- Several requirements (e.g., R18: ""shall implement all digitalization procedures with minimal disruption"") could be more precisely tied to the transcript and use shall/should more cautiously to mirror the actual stakeholder language.
- R24 (""user-friendly and efficient for booking hotel rooms, classes, and equipment hire"")—""efficient"" is not defined/supported in the transcript, and the quote is from the interviewer's own words, not the stakeholder.

**5. Traceability Errors:**
- Several `source_quote` values are from the interviewer (e.g., R24), not from the stakeholder, which is not strictly in line with the instruction to only use quotes from the transcript as stated by the stakeholder. At a minimum, if an Interviewer's probing/summary is used, it should be clearly justified.
- R23: ""ensure customer bookings are synchronized across resorts to avoid data inconsistency""—the actual quote does not mention ""synchronization"" or ""data inconsistency,"" but instead refers to ""access the data of every resort in each resort,"" conveying visibility, not explicit synchronization.

**6. General Observations:**
- The requirements agent is sometimes inferring reasonable requirements that are industry best practice, but the prompt demanded strict source traceability.
- Not all requirements capture stakeholder nuance—such as change aversion or incrementalism (flexibility for future needs, need for comfort/minimal disruption).

**Primary Failure of Previous Attempt**
The principal failure was insufficient strictness in (a) atomicity, (b) traceability (especially not distinguishing between direct stakeholder utterances and interviewer suggestions), and (c) capturing implied but important non-functional and process requirements such as change management/support, extensibility, privacy/security, and current system integration or migration. The instructions did not emphasize the need to carefully distinguish between stakeholder and interviewer statements, nor to capture process/support requirements and future extensibility.

**Improvement Strategy**
- **Atomicity**: Require requirements to be split if they refer to multiple entities or operations, unless the quote itself compounds them.
- **Traceability**: Enforce that requirements may only be linked to stakeholder utterances, not interviewer paraphrases or confirmations (unless the stakeholder explicitly agrees or corrects).
- **Completeness**: Instruct agent to look for implied needs around change management, support, extensibility, migration, privacy/security, etc., if clearly indicated or strongly implied.
- **Compound Requirements**: Add explicit guidance and examples for splitting requirements when possible, and have agent assess for this before output.
- **Label Quotes**: Make it explicit to cite only stakeholder statements unless marked otherwise.
- **Future/Stakeholder Extensibility**: Add a check for implied needs such as ""I will inform you if something comes up"" (indicates need for stakeholder feedback mechanism or extensibility).
- **Clarify Use of Interviewer Quotes**: Provide direction for when, if ever, to use interviewer quotes, and how to handle interviewer-run clarifications.
- **Current System & Transition**: Instruct the agent to capture requirements relating to the migration or transition from the existing workflows or database.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst specializing in extracting complete, atomic, and traceable system requirements from interview transcripts.

**Your Task:**
Analyze the provided interview transcript and elicit all functional and non-functional requirements directly mentioned or clearly implied by the *stakeholder*, ensuring coverage of all user needs. Your output must be highly rigorous: every requirement must be both fully atomic and strictly traceable to an explicit or directly-confirmed stakeholder statement.

**Context:**
1. `{interview_transcript}`: The complete transcript to analyze, provided below.

**Critical Extraction Instructions:**

- **Atomicity:** Every requirement must describe only a single feature, constraint, or rule, unless the stakeholder’s exact quote explicitly groups multiple items together. Carefully break down all compound or bundled statements. For example, if a quote refers to ""hotel reservations, booking classes, and equipment hire,"" split into three requirements unless the stakeholder lists them inseparably.
- **Strict Source Traceability:** Each requirement must be justified by a verbatim quote from the *stakeholder* alone, or by the stakeholder’s explicit confirmation of an interviewer’s suggestion. Always use the stakeholder’s affirmation as your `source_quote` in such cases. Do not use summary, paraphrase, or inference from the interviewer’s statements unless they are explicitly confirmed by the stakeholder.
- **Completeness:** Capture ALL requirements, both functional and non-functional, relating to process, transition, digitalization, data migration, system extensibility, security/privacy, reporting/analytics, staff training/support, access control, public-facing website, customer portal, and integration with (or replacement of) existing systems. If the stakeholder expresses indifference (“I don’t care”), include this as a requirement (e.g., “The system shall not require specialized training prior to launch, unless needed for phased implementation, as the stakeholder expressed no preference.”)
- **Website vs. Portal Distinction:** Explicitly distinguish between requirements that pertain to the customer-facing public website and those for the authenticated customer portal. If the stakeholder groups them in a single statement, split according to context for greatest clarity.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** If the transcript implies needs relating to privacy, security, auditability, disruption minimization, performance (e.g., “live updates”), or similar, capture each as a distinct, atomic requirement.
- **Legacy System Transition:** If semi-manual or legacy systems are referenced, include requirements for data migration and the smooth phase-out or integration of these systems, as implied by the stakeholder’s statements about disruption and transition.
- **Access Control:** If the stakeholder prescribes different permissions for different roles, create a separate requirement for each unique access or edit right.
- **No Redundancies:** Do NOT duplicate requirements (e.g., do not state the same customer portal feature twice with different wording).

**Output and Quality Requirements:**
- **Output Format:** Only output a single, valid JSON object as shown below. The root must be `""requirements""`, containing a list of requirement objects.
- **Requirement Structure:**
    - `id`: A unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
    - `statement`: A clear, formal statement starting with ""The system shall..."" or ""The system must..."" that can be interpreted only one way.
    - `source_quote`: A verbatim quote from the stakeholder supporting this requirement.
- **Max Requirements:** Do not extract more than 30 requirements, focus on those that are critical, distinct, and clearly supported.
- **Clarity and Precision:** Requirements must be concise and unambiguous, easily implementable, and based solely on the source or confirmed stakeholder statement.

**Example Format:**

Stakeholder: Hello
Interviewer: Hello, I'm GPTREI, your requirements elicitation assistant. Today, I will be gathering detailed information about your project needs to ensure we understand all requirements clearly. Before we begin, are you in line with the scope of this interview, or do your expectations of this interview differ?
Stakeholder: I am in line
Interviewer: Great! To start off, could you please introduce yourself and your connection to this project?
Stakeholder: My name is Mary Smith and I am the owner of cool ski resorts
Interviewer: Thank you for the introduction, Mary. How would you describe the project we're discussing today in two to four sentences?
Stakeholder: Cool Ski Resorts is a chain of three ski resorts located in various mountains in the US. The resorts of this company provide services for their customers who come to the mountains for a skiing holiday. The services for the customers include room bookings at the resort hotel, ski equipment and clothing hire, and ski training classes.
Interviewer: Thank you for the overview, Mary. Now, could you describe the current systems and workflows you use to manage bookings, equipment rental, and ski training classes?
Stakeholder: currently all resorts have a simple system for reservations by telephone or fax and the bookings are all handled semi-manually with a local database. i have assistants to keep track of the financial stuff
Interviewer: Thanks for sharing that, Mary. Now, what current processes do you want to change or improve, or what are the features you hope to get from this project?
Stakeholder: i wish to digitalize everything without much disruption
Interviewer: Understood, Mary. So, the primary features you're looking for include digitalizing reservations, equipment rentals, ski training class management, and financial tracking. Is that correct?
Stakeholder: correct and i want to be able to access the data of every resort in each resort
Interviewer: Got it. Are there any other features you would like to see in this project? Perhaps something that has not been the primary focus so far?
Stakeholder: a nice website design for my customers with features like a weather forecast and i want more promotion via social media
Interviewer: Thank you for those details, Mary. Based on your description, do you think including an online customer portal for booking and managing their reservations might also be beneficial?
Stakeholder: yes of course that would be necessary actually
Interviewer: Great, let's proceed with prioritizing these features. Which of these features—digitalizing operations, accessing resort data, website design, weather forecasts, social media promotion, and an online customer portal—are your top priorities?
Stakeholder: customer portal, access to data and digitalization
Interviewer: Thank you for prioritizing those features, Mary. Let's start by gathering detailed requirements for the customer portal. Could you please elaborate on what you want this online customer portal to accomplish?
Stakeholder: hotel reservations, booking classes and potential hiring
Interviewer: Thank you for clarifying that. Could you describe more about how you envision customers interacting with the portal for booking hotel reservations, classes, and hiring equipment? Any specific steps or features you have in mind?
Stakeholder: no thats up to you
Interviewer: Thank you for your flexibility, Mary. We'll ensure the portal is user-friendly and efficient for booking hotel reservations, classes, and equipment hire. Now, let's discuss the next priority—accessing resort data across all locations. Could you explain what type of data you want access to and how you plan to use it?
Stakeholder: i want a database that keeps track of reservations, inventory, bookings and hirings in each resort
Interviewer: Understood, Mary. For the access to this centralized database, how frequently do you need the data updated, and what kind of reports or analytics would you find useful?
Stakeholder: live updates and payment data
Interviewer: Thank you for that detail, Mary. Before we move on to digitalization, could you specify if certain staff roles should have different levels of access to this data? For instance, viewing versus editing rights?
Stakeholder: viewing is fine for everybody but only the lead of each resort should be able to edit unless its bookings then the receptionist should too
Interviewer: Got it, Mary. Now, regarding digitalization of operations, can you elaborate on what specific aspects you want to digitalize and any preferences you have for the transition process?
Stakeholder: everything should be digital and as long as the transition is without disruptions i dont care
Interviewer: Thank you for the clarification, Mary. So, to ensure a smooth transition, would you prefer phased implementation or would you consider comprehensive training for your staff prior to the launch?
Stakeholder: phased implementation
Interviewer: Great choice, Mary. Now, let's confirm the gathered details: a customer portal for managing bookings, a centralized database with live updates and tailored access, and phased implementation for digitalization. Is there anything else you'd like to add or adjust on these points?
Stakeholder: no that would be all thank you
Interviewer: You're welcome, Mary. To wrap up, could you suggest who else might have valuable insights into this project and whose needs we should consider?
Stakeholder: i will inform you if something comes up
Interviewer: Thank you, Mary. To conclude, we’ve covered the key points regarding the customer portal, centralized data access, and phased digitalization. I appreciate your time and insights today. We will follow up with any additional questions or clarifications needed. Based on our discussion, I will prepare a detailed summary and share it with you for review. Thank you once again!
Stakeholder: Thank you bye
Interviewer: You're welcome, Mary. Goodbye, and have a great day!
```";"**1. Missing Requirements**
- **Data Privacy and Security:** The transcript strongly implies the importance of sensitive data (financial, payments) being tracked and accessed by multiple roles (e.g., “i have assistants to keep track of the financial stuff”, “payment data”, “viewing is fine for everybody but only the lead of each resort should be able to edit unless its bookings then the receptionist should too”). No explicit requirements were included to address secure handling, auditability, or privacy of this data.
- **Reporting/Analytics:** The interviewer specifically asks about reports and analytics (""what kind of reports or analytics would you find useful?"") and while the stakeholder does not answer directly, the mention of ""payment data"" and the wish for live updates indirectly calls for reporting/audit requirements that were not reflected.
- **Support/Training Preference:** The interviewer asks whether phased implementation or training is preferred, and the stakeholder chooses phased implementation, but also says ""as long as the transition is without disruptions i dont care."" This suggests at least indifference but no explicit aversion or acceptance of training/support, however, the system requirements did not surface even this minimal support stance, nor did they make clear the absence of a strong preference.
- **De-duplication and Clarity on Website vs Portal:** It's not always clear in the requirements list what's meant to be “website” features vs. “customer portal” features (e.g., the weather forecast function could be ambiguous: is it on the main website or in the customer portal?).
- **Scope Control and Role Management:** There’s a need for traceability and accurate mapping of stakeholder intent to every requirement, particularly for access rights (maybe sufficient, but this can be clarified).
- **Booking Class/Equipment Hiring Granularity:** There is some compounding of functions (e.g., booking classes and equipment hiring) that could be atomized further, since the stakeholder lists them separately (""hotel reservations, booking classes and potential hiring"").
- **Legacy System Migration:** The requirement for data migration is covered, but there is no explicit note about compatibility with or shutdown of old systems, although the transition is mentioned.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** There is mention of “live updates,” “phased implementation,” and “user-friendly” but there’s no coverage of required uptime, performance (speed), or other qualitative measures.

**2. Misinterpreted or Over-Compounded Requirements**
- Several requirements combine several features that could be split:
    - R1 and R2: Digitalization of “reservations, equipment rentals, ski training class management, and financial tracking” is all in one, might be better as atomic.
    - R8 and R9: Both reference the customer portal for hotel reservations, booking classes, and equipment hire—possibly a double-coverage or confusing redundancy.
- R14: The staff access control requirement is accurate but could be split into atomic rights: (a) viewing for all, (b) lead editing except bookings, (c) receptionist can edit bookings.

**3. Unclear Phrasing**
- Some requirements' statements could be more precise and less ambiguous (e.g., ""The system shall support digitalization of all resort operations..."" is a vague catch-all if not broken into atomic features).

**4. Source Quote Traceability Issues**
- R2's source quote: ""The services for the customers include room bookings at the resort hotel, ski equipment and clothing hire, and ski training classes."" This is a description of current offerings, not a stakeholder-stated requirement for digital management. The digital aspect is in later validated answers.
- R13: ""The system must track payment data..."" is split from R12, both derived from the same quote, but it is unclear whether “payment data” refers to tracking payments or only to reporting/analytic needs.

**Summary—Primary Failure:**  
While the prompt results in generally reasonable coverage of main features, the most critical failure is insufficient **atomicity and granularity:** several requirements are compound (especially for digitalization of multiple workflows, access control rights, and customer portal features) and some requirements are not sufficiently split, leading to ambiguities and possible redundancy. Furthermore, **non-functional requirements** around security, privacy, and support/training are not well captured, and some requirements lack precise traceability or have inaccurate/insufficient source quotes.

**Improvement Strategy:**  
- Explicitly instruct the agent to:
   - Atomize requirements unless the stakeholder quote groups them.
   - Pay extra attention to splitting access control rights and digitalization features.
   - Distinguish features of the public website from customer portal functions.
   - Surface non-functional requirements around privacy, security, and performance if implied.
   - Include the stakeholder's indifference to training/support as a requirement.
   - Cross-check source quotes for clarity and appropriateness.
   - Avoid redundant requirements covering the same feature (e.g., customer portal).
- Add explicit reminders to look for ambiguous/compound statements and resolve them using the atomicity guideline.
- Require checking every atomic requirement’s traceability and explanation.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to carefully analyze an interview transcript and extract all system requirements mentioned by the speaker.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, elicit all requirements (include both functional and non-functional requirements, you do not need to specify or categorize). Your primary goal is to capture the user's needs as accurately and completely as possible.

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The original source transcript.

**Constraint: Do not elicit more than 30 requirements.** Focus only on the most critical and distinct user needs mentioned in the transcript.

**Guidelines for High-Quality Requirements:**
To ensure the requirements you extract are clear and useful, please follow these best practices:
- **Clarity:** The requirement should have only one clear interpretation.
- **Atomicity:** Each requirement should describe a single, distinct need. Avoid combining multiple ideas into one statement.
- **Completeness:** The requirement statement should be a full sentence that expresses a complete thought.
- **Source-Based:** Every requirement you list must be directly supported by a statement or a strong implication from the transcript.

**Output Format:**
You MUST produce your output as a single, valid JSON object. The root key must be ""requirements"", which contains a list of individual requirement objects. Provide only the JSON and no other commentary.

Each requirement object in the list must have the following structure:
- `id`: A simple, unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
- `statement`: The requirement text, written as a clear, formal sentence (e.g., ""The system shall..."").
- `source_quote`: A direct, verbatim quote from the transcript that justifies the requirement, ensuring traceability. Give a literal quote, not a summary or paraphrase. Make sure the quotes are verbatim from the transcript.

**Example of the required JSON structure:**
```json

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to extract all system requirements from the following interview transcript with rigorous attention to stakeholder intent, atomicity, traceability, and explicit feature inclusion/exclusion.

**Task:**
Carefully analyze the provided interview transcript and elicit all requirements (functional and non-functional) that are directly **expressed or explicitly affirmed by the stakeholder's own words**. Your primary goal is to capture all critical, distinct user needs *that are explicitly stated or clearly endorsed by the stakeholder*.

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The original source transcript.

**Extraction Guidelines:**
- **Stakeholder-Confirmed Only:** Only include a requirement if it is explicitly stated or actively and clearly affirmed by the stakeholder in their replies. DO NOT derive requirements solely from the interviewer's questions or suggestions unless the stakeholder expresses clear agreement.
- **Feature Exclusions:** If the stakeholder **rejects or declines** a feature (e.g., feedback system, loyalty programs), record an explicit *negative requirement* (e.g., ""The system shall not provide a loyalty program""), citing the verbatim stakeholder quote.
- **Atomicity:** Split out every requirement so it represents a single, distinct feature or constraint. Do not write compound requirements that combine multiple features or capabilities.
- **Service and Role Distinctions:** If the stakeholder differentiates between services, user types, or staff roles (e.g., appointment-only services, part-time vs. full-time staff), extract these as separate business rules or requirements.
- **Reporting and Analytics:** If the stakeholder names specific analytics (peak hours, popular services, etc.), extract each as a separate, atomic requirement.
- **Business Rules & Constraints:** Include any rules, constraints, or preferences the stakeholder expresses around workflow, automation, integration, scheduling, or other operations.
- **Automation & Efficiency:** If the stakeholder requests automation, identify both general (""as much as possible automated"") and specific (e.g., ""automated booking process"") requirements.
- **Non-functional requirements:** Extract any performance, usability, integration, or automation requirements directly stated or clearly required by the stakeholder.
- **Traceability:** For each requirement, the `source_quote` MUST be a **verbatim quote from the stakeholder's reply**, NOT from the interviewer or a paraphrase. If the stakeholder affirms an interviewer proposal specifically (e.g., by responding ""yes"" to a direct question), you may use both the question and the stakeholder's reply as the supporting quote.

**Negative Requirements:**
- If the stakeholder explicitly denies a feature or capability, create a requirement stating that this feature shall *not* be included, e.g., ""The system shall not provide a loyalty program.""
- Use the stakeholder's verbatim rejection as `source_quote`.

**Constraint: No more than 30 requirements.** Prioritize all critical, distinct, and explicitly stated or confirmed user needs.

**Output Format:**
You MUST produce your output as a single, valid JSON object. The root key must be ""requirements"", which contains a list of individual requirement objects. Provide only the JSON and no other commentary.

Each requirement object must have:
- `id`: A unique identifier (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
- `statement`: A clear, formal, atomic requirement (e.g., ""The system shall..."").
- `source_quote`: A direct, verbatim quote from the stakeholder reply that justifies the requirement.

**Example:**
```json

**Begin with the following transcript:**

Stakeholder: Hello  
Interviewer: Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. To get started, could you please tell me a bit about your business and your role within it?  
Stakeholder: Hello, I am Jim and I have a salon near a university. I am the owner of this business and my role is to manage my twelve staff as well as the reservations.  
Interviewer: Great to meet you, Jim! Could you tell me more about the range of services your salon offers and what your typical clientele looks like?  
Stakeholder: yes as much as possible should be automated  
Stakeholder: Since its near a university I have a lot of students walk in or make an appointment, but also some older people who are typically busier and therefore tend to make appointments. Also we offer haircuts, coloring, washing and blow-drying, style cutting, manicure, and facials  
Interviewer: It sounds like you have a diverse range of services that cater to various customer needs. How do you currently handle appointments and manage your staff schedules? Are there any challenges you face in these areas?  
Stakeholder: so for the latter two services we only take appointments and they are done by my part timers. I manage my staff accourding to what i think how busy it will get. But this is not always easy. Often times we are short staffed or overstaffed  
Interviewer: It sounds like managing staff schedules based on anticipated customer demand can be challenging. Are you considering any tools or systems to help streamline appointment scheduling and staff management? If so, what are you looking for in such a solution?  
Stakeholder: I want something to track or predict how many customers might be walk in and how many appointments we are expecting.  
Interviewer: That's a sensible approach to optimize your staffing and resources. Would you be interested in a system that also utilizes past data to make these predictions, or are there specific features you envision that would assist in forecasting customer flow?  
Stakeholder: Yes, but it should also consider the university's influence. Obviously we have more customers when they dont have classes  
Interviewer: Incorporating the university's schedule into predictions makes a lot of sense given your location. Would you like this system to integrate directly with any other tools or systems you currently use, such as point-of-sale systems or customer management software?  
Stakeholder: I dont know  
Interviewer: That's completely fine! We can explore different integration options based on your current operations as we dive deeper. Are there other particular business processes or pain points in your salon that you would like this new system or any improvements to address?  
Stakeholder: yes, i want the booking system to be automated. Doing it per hand is tiring  
Interviewer: Automating the booking process could definitely ease the workload and improve efficiency. Do you envision the system handling online bookings through a website or app, and would you like it to send confirmations and reminders to customers once they book an appointment?  
Stakeholder: it should be integrated in a way where the bookkeeping will be easier  
Interviewer: Integrating the booking system with your bookkeeping process can certainly help streamline financial management. Are there specific financial reports or data insights you’d like to gain from this integration, such as revenue tracking per service, customer spending habits, or staff performance metrics?  
Stakeholder: i want to do Fast Accounts  
Interviewer: Great, integrating with Fast Accounts can facilitate efficient financial management. Would you like the system to automate certain bookkeeping tasks, such as invoicing or expense tracking, or are there any particular features of Fast Accounts that you find particularly useful and would like to enhance?  
Interviewer: That makes perfect sense for improving efficiency. Are there any other areas in your salon operations where you'd like to see increased automation or enhancements, such as marketing or customer communication?  
Stakeholder: we dont need marketing or such, but we would like to use the booking system's data to run the business more efficiently  
Interviewer: Utilizing booking data to enhance operational efficiency is a smart approach. Are there specific types of analytics or insights you’d like the system to provide, such as peak hours, popular services, or customer demographics, that could help in making more informed business decisions?  
Stakeholder: i want to keep track of customer demands and allocate sufficient staff and schedule it  
Interviewer: Understood. Would you like the system to provide recommendations for staff scheduling based on predicted customer demand patterns, or perhaps even automatically adjust schedules and notify staff of their shifts?  
Stakeholder: yes  
Interviewer: That sounds like a comprehensive solution to improve operational efficiency. Are there any other features or functionalities you'd like this system to include, such as customer feedback integration, loyalty programs, or staff performance tracking?  
Stakeholder: Yes but no loyalty programs  
Interviewer: Got it, we can focus on customer feedback integration and staff performance tracking. For customer feedback, would you prefer the system to automatically request feedback after appointments and compile reports for review? And regarding staff performance, are there specific metrics or information that would be most useful for you to track?  
Stakeholder: no  
Interviewer: No problem! If you have other specific requirements or any additional thoughts on what you’d like to achieve with this new system, feel free to share. Otherwise, we can summarize what we've discussed so far to ensure it aligns with your vision.  
Stakeholder: ok  
Interviewer: Here's a quick summary of what we've discussed:
1. **Customer Flow Prediction**: A system that predicts customer walk-ins and appointments while considering influences like the university's schedule.
2. **Automated Booking System**: To handle online bookings, send confirmations and reminders, and integrate with Fast Accounts for easier bookkeeping.
3. **Data-Driven Efficiency**: Utilize booking data to improve business efficiency by tracking customer demands and optimizing staff scheduling.
4. **Automatic Staff Scheduling**: Based on predicted customer demands, with notifications for staff shifts.
5. **Feedback Integration and Staff Tracking**: Although specifics were declined, there is an interest in enhancing operational efficiency and staff management.
Is there anything significant missing or anything else you'd like to elaborate on?  
Stakeholder: so does the system Offer a booking system for clients to make appointments Keep track of her/his business records (receipts, expenses, wages, GST, etc.) Keep track of supplies and notify her/him when supplies are running out and should be ordered Provide data in form of reports to run the business more efficiently  
Interviewer: Yes, based on the requirements we've discussed, the system should offer the following capabilities:  
1. **Booking System for Clients**: Allow clients to seamlessly make appointments online, with automated confirmations and reminders.
2. **Business Record Management**: Integrate with Fast Accounts to keep track of business records such as receipts, expenses, wages, and GST.
3. **Inventory Management**: Track supplies and provide notifications when they are running low and need to be reordered.
4. **Data Reports for Business Efficiency**: Provide detailed reports and analytics to help you run the business more efficiently, potentially including demand forecasting and staff scheduling recommendations.
Does this align with your needs, or are there any additional features you'd like to include or modify?  
Stakeholder: ok thats all i need  
Interviewer: Perfect! With these requirements in mind, you'll have a solid foundation for developing a system that enhances your salon's operations. If you have any further questions or need additional support as you move forward, feel free to reach out. Best of luck with implementing your new system!
```";"**1. Missing Requirements**
- **Comprehensive Service List:** The agent did not explicitly identify that the system should record or support all offered services, as mentioned by the stakeholder (“we offer haircuts, coloring, washing and blow-drying, style cutting, manicure, and facials”). While there is some implication in requirements related to categorical reports and scheduling, the explicit need to capture or support all service types is not stated.
- **Clientele Insights:** There is no explicit requirement to capture or segment data about customer types (students vs. older people), even though the transcript shows this distinction is important for demand prediction and possibly marketing.
- **Reporting Preferences:** Some analytics/reporting requirements are bundled or vague, for example, explicit requirements to report on peak hours, popular services, customer demographics, or revenue by category are not individually broken out per the discussion.
- **Manual Staffing Challenges:** While there’s mention of optimizing and automating scheduling, the problem that “Often times we are short staffed or overstaffed” is not distinctly reflected as a pain point the system should address (for example, an alert mechanism or diagnostic reporting on staff coverage).
- **Customization/Configurability:** The stakeholder expresses opt-out for marketing and loyalty programs, but there is no requirement to allow enabling/disabling such features.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** The system’s need for automation (“yes as much as possible should be automated”) is not translated into a general non-functional automation requirement—only into specific automation requests.
- **Language/Internationalization:** No reference to user interface, language options, or accessibility, though these may be inferred as missing based on user type but not directly requested.

**2. Misinterpreted Requirements**
- **Feedback Collection:** Requirement R19 (“The system shall compile and provide reports based on feedback collected after appointments.”) is not accurate, as the stakeholder explicitly declines this feature (“no” after being asked if the system should handle feedback reports).
- **Service/Staff Segmentation:** Several requirements (R24, R26, R27) blur service distinctions and staff roles, none makes explicit that the system must distinguish and separately handle appointments for manicure & facial services versus other walk-in/appointment mixed services.
- **Customer Feedback Mechanisms:** R23 (“The system shall provide mechanisms for integrating customer feedback to enhance operational efficiency.”) is not supported, since the stakeholder declined feedback mechanisms beyond a general interest.

**3. Compound Requirements**
- Some requirements combine several distinct needs:
    - R3 mixes booking, confirmations, and bookkeeping integration.
    - R20 fuses demand forecasting and staff scheduling in one.
- Such requirements should be split for clarity and atomicity.

**4. Poor Phrasing**
- Some requirements are generic (“The system shall provide reports and analytics to improve business efficiency.”) and could be broken into more actionable items.
- R6 and R14 are vague about specificity of data usage.
- The phrase “automate bookkeeping activities where possible” (R10) is ambiguous—as “where possible” lacks definition.

**5. Traceability Errors**
- Some source quotes are not strictly verbatim from the transcript but appear to summarize dialogue across multiple turns.
- Requirements R3 and R20 use composite quotes or select from interviewer questions, diluting the clarity of support from the actual stakeholder’s own statements.
- R19's quote is from an interviewer question immediately followed by ""no,"" indicating it should not be a requirement.

**Primary Failure of the Previous Attempt:**
The main failure of the previous prompt was insufficient attention to strict atomicity, traceability, and the explicit exclusion of features (such as customer loyalty/feedback programs) that the stakeholder declined. This led to inclusion of features the user rejected, omission of distinctly mentioned needs, and poorly granular/compound requirements.

**Strategy for Improvement:**
The main corrections required are:
- Instruct the agent to create ONLY requirements that are explicitly supported or strongly implied by the STAKEHOLDER'S responses, and NOT the interviewer’s suggestions/questions unless affirmed by the stakeholder.
- Direct the agent to split compound requirements and target atomicity—every requirement covers only one feature or constraint.
- Require that exclusion statements (e.g., “no loyalty programs”, “no feedback reports”) are respected and not included as requirements.
- Emphasize that requirements must use only verbatim quotes spoken by the stakeholder (not interviewer) as the primary source, unless the stakeholder explicitly affirms/accepts the interviewer’s suggestion.
- Suggest the agent also record requirements indicating feature opt-out, where the user clearly specifies non-requirements (negative requirements).
- Remind the agent to extract explicit service distinctions, user types, and all clearly stated business rules.
- Encourage the agent to scan for non-functional requirements (automation, performance, integration ease, etc.) if directly mentioned or strongly implied.

**System Role:** You are a meticulous Systems Analyst. Your assignment is to extract every functional and non-functional requirement from the following interview transcript, demonstrating rigorous attention to atomicity, traceability, and explicit feature inclusion or exclusion.

**Task:**  
Carefully review the transcript and elicit all actionable, atomic requirements—both functional and non-functional—that are **directly expressed, explicitly affirmed, or clearly accepted** by the stakeholder, using only their own words or their unambiguous agreement to interviewer proposals.

---

**Extraction Directives:**

1. **Stakeholder-Confirmed Only:**  
   Extract a requirement ONLY if the stakeholder:
   - Explicitly states a need, feature, rule, or exclusion in their reply
   - Actively and unmistakably affirms a specific proposal made by the interviewer (e.g. by replying ""yes"", ""ok"" when asked for confirmation, or otherwise signaling final agreement)
   - Summarily accepts a list of features summarized by the interviewer by explicitly indicating requirements gathering is complete (e.g., ""ok that's all i need"").

2. **Verbatim Traceability:**  
   - For each requirement, the `source_quote` must include the **full, verbatim exchange** constituting stakeholder agreement. If the stakeholder affirms an interviewer proposal, include both the exact interviewer proposal/question/summary and the stakeholder's direct reply in the `source_quote`.
   - Do NOT paraphrase or summarize the stakeholder’s words.  
   - For single-statement needs, quote the entire relevant stakeholder sentence.

3. **Atomicity and Splitting:**  
   - Personalize each requirement so it describes a single, discrete, clear system behavior, rule, or constraint.
   - Where the stakeholder lists multiple records, reports, or features (e.g., ""receipts, expenses, wages, GST""), create a SEPARATE requirement for each, unless the stakeholder’s language unavoidably combines them.
   - Do not group unrelated features, actions, or rules together.

4. **Negative Requirements (Declines):**
   - For any feature the stakeholder *explicitly rejects or declines* (e.g., loyalty programs, marketing, feedback systems), include a negative requirement (e.g., ""The system shall not provide a loyalty program"") citing the stakeholder’s full rejection as the `source_quote`.
   - If the stakeholder says “no” to feedback system or other features, treat this as a negative requirement.

5. **Distinguish Existing Reality from Requirements:**
   - Only extract a system requirement if the stakeholder indicates wanting that feature, *not* simply when describing current business practices.
   - If current business behavior (e.g., supporting walk-in and booked customers) is re-affirmed by the stakeholder as a desired system behavior, extract as a requirement, otherwise, do not infer.

6. **Non-Functional and Usability Requirements:**
   - When the stakeholder mentions effort/pain points or efficiency/ease, translate these into explicit non-functional (e.g., usability, automation) requirements using their precise words (e.g., “Doing it per hand is tiring” → “The system shall be easy to use to reduce manual effort”).

7. **Summary Affirmation:**
   - If, after a summary of features by the interviewer, the stakeholder expresses overall approval (e.g., “ok thats all i need”), you may extract requirements for each item that appears in the interviewer summary. In such cases, include BOTH the summary and the affirmative as the `source_quote`.

8. **No Inference from Unaffirmed Suggestions:**  
   - When the stakeholder does NOT respond affirmatively to a feature mentioned by the interviewer, DO NOT include it as a requirement (e.g., online confirmations, reminders, customer feedback system).

9. **Output Formatting:**  
   - Your output must be a single, valid JSON object, using `""requirements""` as the root key and a list of requirement objects.
   - Each object must have:
       - `""id""`: A unique identifier (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"", ...).
       - `""statement""`: A clear, actionable, atomic requirement (e.g., ""The system shall..."").
       - `""source_quote""`: The **complete, verbatim stakeholder quote and/or interviewer-stakeholder exchange** that justifies the requirement, as per above.
   - Provide only the JSON output. Do NOT offer any analysis or commentary.

**Constraint:** No more than 30 requirements. If more than 30 are identified, prioritize the most critical and explicit needs.

**Example:**
```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall not provide a loyalty program."",
      ""source_quote"": ""Stakeholder: Yes but no loyalty programs""
    }},
    {{
      ""id"": ""R2"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall restrict booking for manicures and facials to appointment-only."",
      ""source_quote"": ""Stakeholder: so for the latter two services we only take appointments""
    }},
    {{
      ""id"": ""R3"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall be easy to use to reduce manual effort."",
      ""source_quote"": ""Stakeholder: yes, i want the booking system to be automated. Doing it per hand is tiring""
    }}
  ]
}}
```

**Begin with the following transcript:**

Stakeholder: Hello  
Interviewer: Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. To get started, could you please tell me a bit about your business and your role within it?  
Stakeholder: Hello, I am Jim and I have a salon near a university. I am the owner of this business and my role is to manage my twelve staff as well as the reservations.  
Interviewer: Great to meet you, Jim! Could you tell me more about the range of services your salon offers and what your typical clientele looks like?  
Stakeholder: yes as much as possible should be automated  
Stakeholder: Since its near a university I have a lot of students walk in or make an appointment, but also some older people who are typically busier and therefore tend to make appointments. Also we offer haircuts, coloring, washing and blow-drying, style cutting, manicure, and facials  
Interviewer: It sounds like you have a diverse range of services that cater to various customer needs. How do you currently handle appointments and manage your staff schedules? Are there any challenges you face in these areas?  
Stakeholder: so for the latter two services we only take appointments and they are done by my part timers. I manage my staff accourding to what i think how busy it will get. But this is not always easy. Often times we are short staffed or overstaffed  
Interviewer: It sounds like managing staff schedules based on anticipated customer demand can be challenging. Are you considering any tools or systems to help streamline appointment scheduling and staff management? If so, what are you looking for in such a solution?  
Stakeholder: I want something to track or predict how many customers might be walk in and how many appointments we are expecting.  
Interviewer: That's a sensible approach to optimize your staffing and resources. Would you be interested in a system that also utilizes past data to make these predictions, or are there specific features you envision that would assist in forecasting customer flow?  
Stakeholder: Yes, but it should also consider the university's influence. Obviously we have more customers when they dont have classes  
Interviewer: Incorporating the university's schedule into predictions makes a lot of sense given your location. Would you like this system to integrate directly with any other tools or systems you currently use, such as point-of-sale systems or customer management software?  
Stakeholder: I dont know  
Interviewer: That's completely fine! We can explore different integration options based on your current operations as we dive deeper. Are there other particular business processes or pain points in your salon that you would like this new system or any improvements to address?  
Stakeholder: yes, i want the booking system to be automated. Doing it per hand is tiring  
Interviewer: Automating the booking process could definitely ease the workload and improve efficiency. Do you envision the system handling online bookings through a website or app, and would you like it to send confirmations and reminders to customers once they book an appointment?  
Stakeholder: it should be integrated in a way where the bookkeeping will be easier  
Interviewer: Integrating the booking system with your bookkeeping process can certainly help streamline financial management. Are there specific financial reports or data insights you’d like to gain from this integration, such as revenue tracking per service, customer spending habits, or staff performance metrics?  
Stakeholder: i want to do Fast Accounts  
Interviewer: Great, integrating with Fast Accounts can facilitate efficient financial management. Would you like the system to automate certain bookkeeping tasks, such as invoicing or expense tracking, or are there any particular features of Fast Accounts that you find particularly useful and would like to enhance?  
Interviewer: That makes perfect sense for improving efficiency. Are there any other areas in your salon operations where you'd like to see increased automation or enhancements, such as marketing or customer communication?  
Stakeholder: we dont need marketing or such, but we would like to use the booking system's data to run the business more efficiently  
Interviewer: Utilizing booking data to enhance operational efficiency is a smart approach. Are there specific types of analytics or insights you’d like the system to provide, such as peak hours, popular services, or customer demographics, that could help in making more informed business decisions?  
Stakeholder: i want to keep track of customer demands and allocate sufficient staff and schedule it  
Interviewer: Understood. Would you like the system to provide recommendations for staff scheduling based on predicted customer demand patterns, or perhaps even automatically adjust schedules and notify staff of their shifts?  
Stakeholder: yes  
Interviewer: That sounds like a comprehensive solution to improve operational efficiency. Are there any other features or functionalities you'd like this system to include, such as customer feedback integration, loyalty programs, or staff performance tracking?  
Stakeholder: Yes but no loyalty programs  
Interviewer: Got it, we can focus on customer feedback integration and staff performance tracking. For customer feedback, would you prefer the system to automatically request feedback after appointments and compile reports for review? And regarding staff performance, are there specific metrics or information that would be most useful for you to track?  
Stakeholder: no  
Interviewer: No problem! If you have other specific requirements or any additional thoughts on what you’d like to achieve with this new system, feel free to share. Otherwise, we can summarize what we've discussed so far to ensure it aligns with your vision.
Stakeholder: ok
Interviewer: Here's a quick summary of what we've discussed:

1. **Customer Flow Prediction**: A system that predicts customer walk-ins and appointments while considering influences like the university's schedule.

2. **Automated Booking System**: To handle online bookings, send confirmations and reminders, and integrate with Fast Accounts for easier bookkeeping.

3. **Data-Driven Efficiency**: Utilize booking data to improve business efficiency by tracking customer demands and optimizing staff scheduling.

4. **Automatic Staff Scheduling**: Based on predicted customer demands, with notifications for staff shifts.

5. **Feedback Integration and Staff Tracking**: Although specifics were declined, there is an interest in enhancing operational efficiency and staff management.

Is there anything significant missing or anything else you'd like to elaborate on?
Stakeholder: so does the system Offer a booking system for clients to make appointments Keep track of her/his business records (receipts, expenses, wages, GST, etc.) Keep track of supplies and notify her/him when supplies are running out and should be ordered Provide data in form of reports to run the business more efficiently
Interviewer: Yes, based on the requirements we've discussed, the system should offer the following capabilities:

1. **Booking System for Clients**: Allow clients to seamlessly make appointments online, with automated confirmations and reminders.

2. **Business Record Management**: Integrate with Fast Accounts to keep track of business records such as receipts, expenses, wages, and GST.

3. **Inventory Management**: Track supplies and provide notifications when they are running low and need to be reordered.

4. **Data Reports for Business Efficiency**: Provide detailed reports and analytics to help you run the business more efficiently, potentially including demand forecasting and staff scheduling recommendations.

Does this align with your needs, or are there any additional features you'd like to include or modify?
Stakeholder: ok thats all i need
Interviewer: Perfect! With these requirements in mind, you'll have a solid foundation for developing a system that enhances your salon's operations. If you have any further questions or need additional support as you move forward, feel free to reach out. Best of luck with implementing your new system!
````";"**Gap Analysis – Summary:**

**A. Missing Requirements**
1. **Online Booking, Confirmations, and Reminders:**  
   The stakeholder did not explicitly affirm wanting *online* booking or automated confirmations/reminders. The original requirements list incorrectly includes only a general ""automated booking system"" and conflates requirements, but does not split out explicit desires for confirmations/reminders or channel (web/app), which were only offered by the interviewer, not confirmed by the stakeholder.

2. **Requirements Derived Solely from Interviewer Summaries:**  
   In the later part of the transcript, the interviewer summarizes features. The stakeholder responds “ok” or “ok thats all i need” – but the requirements list selectively extracts requirements from the summary. Per the prompt, extraction should occur only if the stakeholder explicitly affirms the feature or responds with clear agreement to the specific interviewer proposal.

3. **Non-Functional and Usability Requirements:**  
   The prompt asks to extract non-functional requirements, but statements about ease (""Doing it per hand is tiring"", ""should be integrated in a way where the bookkeeping will be easier"") are not translated into explicit NFRs (e.g., relating to usability/efficiency/simplicity). Some phrasing is ambiguous as a result.

4. **Declined Features:**  
   The requirements about what *should not* be included are mostly correct (e.g., loyalty programs, marketing features), but no explicit “system shall not provide a customer feedback system” requirement is extracted for the “no” to the interviewer’s feedback-integration question.

5. **Business Record Tracking – Granularity:**  
   The stakeholder refers to ""Keep track of her/his business records (receipts, expenses, wages, GST, etc.)"". In the requirements list, this is only a single requirement, when each trackable should be atomic if mentioned (receipts, expenses, wages, GST).

6. **Possible Over-Inference:**  
   Some requirements (such as R20, “The system shall provide a booking system for clients to make appointments.”) quote the stakeholder's summary, but the context is the stakeholder reading options from the interviewer – and saying ""ok"" at the end. While this is a soft affirmation, strict traceability demands only requirements that are explicitly and actively confirmed, with care at the ""ok"" responses.

**B. Misinterpreted Requirements**
1. **Walk-in Support:**  
   R2 says, ""The system shall support walk-in customers as well as customers with appointments."" The source quote is:  
   ""Since its near a university I have a lot of students walk in or make an appointment, but also some older people who are typically busier and therefore tend to make appointments.""  
   The stakeholder describes *current reality* rather than a system *requirement* for handling both. This is subtle: unless directly or affirmatively requested, support for both customer types is an inference (though reasonable). The requirement could be better worded as “The system shall allow scheduling for both walk-in and appointment customers, as explicitly required.”

2. **Compound Requirements:**  
   Several requirements are compound. For example, R16 (""The system shall allow for staff scheduling based on tracked customer demand."") could/should be split from R15 (""The system shall enable allocation of sufficient staff based on customer demand."").

   Also, business rule requirements about the “latter two services” (manicure/facials: appointment-only, performed by part-timers) are sometimes combined, rather than kept atomic.

**C. Poor Phrasing**
1. **Vague Statements:**  
   Many requirements are too general, such as ""The system shall use booking system data to improve operational efficiency"" or ""The system shall automate as many business processes as possible."" These lack the necessary specificity for actionable system requirements and don’t map closely enough to the stakeholder's words (e.g., “as much as possible should be automated”).

2. **Non-Verbatim Quotes:**  
   Several `source_quote` fields paraphrase rather than directly quote, or combine the interviewer’s text and the stakeholder’s affirmation, but fail to cite precisely which interviewer question was affirmed.

**D. Traceability Errors**
1. **Verbatim Quote Requirement:**  
   In several places, the `source_quote` is a paraphrase or only a fragment, it should be full and verbatim, especially in cases where joint citation is needed (i.e., interviewer’s question and stakeholder’s agreement).

2. **Requirement Justification:**  
   Requirements that are derived solely from a summary, rather than an explicit user affirmation, risk poor traceability. The unique identifier approach is correct, but contextual chain of agreement could be clearer.

**E. Specific Atomicity Issues**
1. **Reporting & Analytics:**  
   The requirement for ""Provide data in form of reports to run the business more efficiently"" is broad, if specific report types were mentioned (they are not here), these should be atomic. For now, the generality is justified, but should be written for better actionability.

2. **Inventory Management:**  
   ""Keep track of supplies and notify her/him when supplies are running out and should be ordered"" is captured in R22 properly.

---

**Primary Failure of the Previous Attempt:**

The primary failure was **imprecise atomicity and traceability**, resulting in several vague or compound requirements, over-generalization, and improper citation of ""source_quote"" (including paraphrases or omitted interviewer context). The extraction also included requirements that were not always explicitly confirmed by the stakeholder, or missed decline requirements (such as for customer feedback integration).

**Improvement Strategy:**
- **Enforce Atomicity:** Each requirement must address ONE feature, rule, or constraint.
- **Verbatim Citation:** Require full, verbatim chain from interviewer proposal to stakeholder confirmation where relevant.
- **Explicit Decline Extraction:** Explicitly extract negative requirements for any declined or rejected feature, with full context.
- **Distinguish Stakeholder Reality vs. System Requirement:** Do not infer requirements from mere description of current business context unless the stakeholder explicitly affirms needing similar system support.
- **Split Requirements Where Multiple Features Are Expressed:** E.g., in lists of records, create a requirement for each item (receipts, wages, GST, etc).
- **Handle Summaries with Care:** When the stakeholder simply says “ok,” only extract requirements outlined in the immediately preceding interviewer summary, and clarify in the prompt that these may be considered confirmed ONLY if the stakeholder expresses active agreement or closes the requirements-gathering session by affirming completeness.
- **Clarify Usability/Non-functional Requirements:** Map stakeholder statements about ""ease"" or ""tiredness"" into usability requirements where possible, using their exact words.
- **Instructions for JSON and Output Consistency:** Retain and reinforce this requirement.

From the provided interview transcript, elicit all requirements (include both functional and non-functional requirements, you do not need to specify or categorize). Your primary goal is to capture the user's needs as accurately and completely as possible.

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The original source transcript.

**Constraint: Do not elicit more than 30 requirements.** Focus only on the most critical and distinct user needs mentioned in the transcript.

**Guidelines for High-Quality Requirements:**
To ensure the requirements you extract are clear and useful, please follow these best practices:
- **Clarity:** The requirement should have only one clear interpretation.
- **Atomicity:** Each requirement should describe a single, distinct need. Avoid combining multiple ideas into one statement.
- **Completeness:** The requirement statement should be a full sentence that expresses a complete thought.
- **Source-Based:** Every requirement you list must be directly supported by a statement or a strong implication from the transcript.

**Output Format:**
You MUST produce your output as a single, valid JSON object. The root key must be ""requirements"", which contains a list of individual requirement objects. Provide only the JSON and no other commentary.

Each requirement object in the list must have the following structure:
- `id`: A simple, unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
- `statement`: The requirement text, written as a clear, formal sentence (e.g., ""The system shall..."").
- `source_quote`: A direct, verbatim quote from the transcript that justifies the requirement, ensuring traceability. Give a literal quote, not a summary or paraphrase. Make sure the quotes are verbatim from the transcript.

**Example of the required JSON structure:**
```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall allow a user to register for a new account using an email address and password."",

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to carefully analyze an interview transcript and extract ALL system requirements mentioned by the stakeholder.

**Critical Instructions for Requirement Extraction (Please read carefully):**

- You must extract requirements *only* from stakeholder statements (or explicit, strong implications of stakeholder needs). Do **NOT** generate requirements based on interviewer questions alone or from your own assumptions.
- Each requirement must be fully supported by a *verbatim* quote from the stakeholder in the transcript—write only the stakeholder’s exact words, not any paraphrasing, synthesized text, or interviewer prompts.
- For every requirement, ensure the source quote is strictly a copy-paste of the stakeholder’s statement that justifies it. If you cannot find a verbatim stakeholder quote, DO NOT write the requirement.
- If the stakeholder implies a non-functional requirement strongly (e.g., simplicity, privacy, security, reliability, legal compliance, accessibility, usability), you must extract it and cite the precise user statement that signals this need.
- Do NOT include requirements purely about project context, background, or process (e.g., ""first digital solution"") unless the stakeholder implies a direct system need from it.
- If you find a stakeholder statement that combines multiple requirements (compound), split it into separate, atomic requirements, each with an appropriate source quote.

**Your Output Format (MANDATORY):**
You MUST output a single, valid JSON object. The root key MUST be ""requirements"", which contains a list of requirement objects. Output only the JSON, do NOT include commentary, explanations, or extraneous text.

Each requirement object MUST have:
- `id`: A simple, unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"", ...).
- `statement`: The requirement, written as a clear, formal sentence (e.g., ""The system shall..."").
- `source_quote`: A *verbatim stakeholder quote* (copied exactly from the transcript, no edits, paraphrases, or summaries).

If a stakeholder statement implies an important non-functional requirement (e.g., privacy, security, reliability), extract it and use the strongest attributable stakeholder phrase as the `source_quote`—do not attribute such requirements to interviewer questions, only to stakeholder’s concerns as stated or clearly implied.

**Example JSON Format:**
```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall allow a user to register for a new account using an email address and password."",
      ""source_quote"": ""So, obviously, a new user needs to be able to sign up, you know, just with their email.""
    }},
    {{
      ""id"": ""R2"",
      ""statement"": ""The system must load the main dashboard in under 2 seconds."",
      ""source_quote"": ""It's just got to be fast, I can't be waiting around for the main page to load.""
    }}
  ]
}}
```

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The original source transcript to analyze.

**Constraints:**
- Do not elicit more than 30 requirements, focus on the most critical and distinct user needs from the stakeholder.
- Each requirement must be atomic (describe 1 distinct need).
- Each source quote must be 100% verbatim (copy-pasted from the stakeholder’s speech, not the interviewer).
- Do not include requirements unless directly justified by stakeholder speech or a clear, strong stakeholder implication.

**Begin analysis using only stakeholder statements from the transcript below:**
{interview_transcript}
```";"**Gap Analysis**

1. **Missing Requirements**
   - **User Roles/Access Control:** The transcript mentions staff and the owner, but the requirements don't explicitly clarify role-based access or permissions (e.g., is there a separate staff view, are staff able to log in?).
   - **Security/Privacy:** There is no mention of basic non-functional requirements regarding privacy and security of sensitive business and client data that are clearly implied by digitizing business records and handling client appointments.
   - **System Usability/Accessibility:** Given repeated stakeholder hesitance about advanced features and a request for simplicity (e.g., just website, only visual for demand), there should be an explicit usability or simplicity requirement.
   - **Data Backup/Recovery:** Transcript implies the system is being used for critical business data, but no requirement was elicited concerning backup or loss-prevention, though this is a crucial non-functional user need for a ""first"" digital solution for business records.
   - **Availability/Uptime:** There’s an implicit need for the booking website to be reliably available for clients, which wasn’t captured.
   - **Localization/Currency:** The system will handle financials (receipts, GST, etc.), but requirements for supporting local language, region, or currency were omitted.
   - **Legal/Compliance:** GST is mentioned, but no explicit requirement ensures legal compliance in financial records.
   - **Printer Support:** Since one quote suggests emailing and digital transfer, but nowhere does the requirements list mention optional support for printing (“Prepare records on this computer…”).

2. **Misinterpreted Requirements**
   - **Compound/Overlapping Requirements:** Several requirements are compound or overlapping:
     - Some requirements are repeated or nearly identical (e.g., R9/R12, R10/R18).
     - R22 and R23 conflate training and a preference against mobile functionality (the source quote for R22 in particular is invalid and incoherent).
   - **Incorrect Use of Source Quotes:** Some `source_quote` fields do not provide a direct quote as instructed, for example, R17 uses just ""first"", which is not only overly minimal but also not helpful for traceability or clarity. R19 uses a quote that is not from the stakeholder.

3. **Compound Requirements**
   - **Requirement Structure:** 
     - R3 combines confirmation for booking and cancellation in a single requirement, these should be separated.
     - R21 (""facilitate more efficient business operations through its reporting features"") is overly broad and combines system utility and output.
     - R14 may conflate presentation for all business data and demand-trend visualizations—a separation would be clearer.
     - R15 potentially combines tracking inventory and notification, these may be clearer as two atomic requirements.

4. **Poor Phrasing**
   - **Vague/Unclear Statements:** 
     - R17 is extremely vague: “The system shall function as the first centralized digital solution for bookkeeping for the salon,” which is more about project context than a system requirement.
     - R21 (“The system shall facilitate more efficient business operations..."") is not a concrete requirement.
   - **Requirements from Non-Stakeholder Statements:** Some requirements (e.g., R19 and possibly others) are inferred from interviewer questions rather than stakeholder needs, violating the guideline that each requirement must be justified by a stakeholder's direct statement or strong implication.

5. **Traceability Errors**
   - **Non-Verbatim Quotes/Paraphrasing:** 
     - Several source quotes are not literal from the transcript (e.g., R17, R19, R22).
     - Some use paraphrase or mental interpolation rather than actual transcript quotes.
   - **Ambiguous References:** R17’s source_quote ""first"" is ambiguous—what statement?, R19 is an interviewer's question, not stakeholder answer.

**Primary Failure Identified:**  
The main failure in the previous attempt was **inadequate traceability and lack of strict adherence to verbatim, stakeholder-driven requirements**. This led to requirements created from interviewers’ words (not user needs), paraphrased/incomplete source quotes, overlooked non-functional but critical stakeholder concerns (privacy, usability, security, reliability), improper atomicity, and inclusion of vague/contextual statements.

**Improvement Strategy:**  
- Explicitly instruct the analyst to use **only stakeholder's direct statements or strong, explicit implications for a requirement**—never from interviewer questions or paraphrases.
- Emphasize **verbatim source quotes**, never allow summarized, interpolated, or interviewer-generated text.
- Direct analyst to check for **implicit non-functional requirements** about security, privacy, reliability, usability if digitizing sensitive business information (as is the case here).
- Require **atomicity:** each requirement must specify one need only.
- For any requirement that combines multiple ideas, instruct the analyst to split them.
- Explain to ignore contextual/project background information as requirements (e.g., “first digital solution”).
- Add a guideline to explicitly check for, and include, non-functional requirements implied by the user’s concern for business continuity, privacy, simplicity, or local compliance.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to carefully extract ALL system requirements stated or strongly implied by the stakeholder from the transcript below.

**Critical Instructions for Requirement Extraction:**

- Extract requirements *only* from direct stakeholder statements or clear, explicit implications in the stakeholder's own words. **Do NOT generate requirements from interviewer questions, your own conjectures, or implied context.**
- Each requirement must be justified by a *verbatim* quote from the stakeholder in the transcript. Use only the full stakeholder sentence or meaningful clause as the `source_quote`—do not paraphrase, summarize, or use mid-sentence fragments out of context.
- For each requirement, ensure that the `statement` is fully, directly justified by the `source_quote`, and that the selected quote is sufficiently broad to cover the requirement's scope (including all components expressed together in the user's original sentence).
- If a stakeholder statement contains several independent requirements (a true, explicit list), you may split these into separate requirements, but **do not split compound or complex sentences into multiple requirements unless each independent need is clearly and distinctly stated by the stakeholder.**
- If you find multiple requirements in overlapping or nearly identical stakeholder statements, **consolidate them** into a single requirement if the user intent and quotes are substantively the same.
- For non-functional requirements (such as simplicity, privacy, reliability, accessibility), include them only if the stakeholder *clearly states or strongly implies* the need. Use the full stakeholder phrase as the `source_quote`.
- Do NOT include requirements that are only about project process (""first digital solution,"" ""I don't know"") or context, unless the user explicitly ties them to a system feature or quality.
- If a user statement is ambiguous or vague (e.g., ""no extra notification""), capture it as a requirement only at the minimum level directly supported by the quote. Do not extrapolate or clarify beyond the user's wording.
- Each requirement must be *atomic* and non-overlapping, unless the stakeholder has bundled multiple, inseparable ideas in a single statement.

**Output Format (MANDATORY):**
Return a single, valid JSON object. 
- The root key MUST be `""requirements""`.
- The value is a list of requirement objects.
- Each requirement object MUST have:
  - `id`: A unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"", ...).
  - `statement`: A clear, formal requirement sentence whose full meaning is directly supported by the chosen `source_quote`.
  - `source_quote`: The *verbatim stakeholder quote*—use a full sentence or meaningful clause. Do not use paraphrased text or partial sentence fragments.

**Example Output:**
```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall allow a user to register for a new account using an email address."",
      ""source_quote"": ""So, obviously, a new user needs to be able to sign up, you know, just with their email.""
    }},
    {{
      ""id"": ""R2"",
      ""statement"": ""The system must load the main dashboard in under 2 seconds."",
      ""source_quote"": ""It's just got to be fast, I can't be waiting around for the main page to load.""
    }}
  ]
}}
```

**STRICT CONSTRAINTS:**
- Do not produce more than 30 requirements. Focus on distinct, critical user needs.
- Make requirements as atomic as possible, unless separation would require guessing or distorting the user's intended meaning.
- Each `source_quote` must be a *full user sentence or full explicit clause*, not a partial fragment or interviewer prompt.
- Only include requirements directly justified by *stakeholder* speech.

**Begin extraction using only the stakeholder’s statements from the transcript below:**
{interview_transcript}
````";"**1. Gap Analysis**

- **Missing Requirements:**
    - *System Language/Localization*: The requirement for which language(s) the system should operate in is not present. However, the transcript has no explicit language requirement from the stakeholder, so this is not missing.
    - *Device Usability*: The stakeholder at no point specifically requires the system to be usable on tablets, desktops, or have any accessibility feature.
    - *Exporting/Formatting Records*: The interviewer asks about report formats (PDF, spreadsheet), but the stakeholder never confirms a requirement here. It is correct *not* to generate requirements based on the interviewer's question alone.
    - *Handling of 'first digital solution'*: No requirements generated—appropriate, as per the prompt.

- **Misinterpreted Requirements:**
    - **Compounded/Redundant requirements** for stylist selection:
        - R13: ""The system shall allow for stylist selection, making available the stylists selected by the user for that week.""
        - R14: ""The system shall support manual selection of stylists for weekly rotation by the user.""
        - Both use the same source quote and are largely duplicative.
    - **Reporting/Diary requirements**: 
        - R17 and R18 are both derived from the same quote and are nearly identical, R17 discusses ""digital diary to allow the user to keep track of customer demand so she/he knows when busy times are,"" and R18 is ""provide information to allow for allocation of sufficient staff on duty based on customer demand trends."" Since the quote is compound, these may be acceptable as split requirements if they’re written distinctly, but they need to be reviewed for atomicity.
    - **Data Visualizations**:
        - R19: ""The system shall present visualizations only for customer demand data.""
        - R20: ""The system shall keep data presentation uniform for all other information except customer demand visualization.""
        - R20 *includes paraphrasing* not present in the user's words (""except customer demand visualization""), the source quote ""presentation should always be the same the information, only visuals for demand please"" only partially supports this, and the interpretation exaggerates the specificity.
    - **Notification requirement for stylists**:
        - R15: ""The system shall not send extra notifications to stylists.""
        - Source quote: ""no extra notification""
        - This phrasing is vague—the stakeholder could mean 'no notification at all,' or just avoid excessive ones. It is insufficient in precision without more context.

- **Compound Requirements:**
    - Several `source_quote`s clearly bundle more than one requirement:
        - ""Offer a booking system for clients to make appointments Keep track of her/his business records (receipts, expenses, wages, GST, etc.) Keep track of supplies and notify her/him when supplies are running out and should be ordered Provide data in form of reports to run the business more efficiently"" – Present as four bundled requirements.
        - ""just website, make a specific appointment and have the option of cancelling up to 24h before appointment. there should be confirmation mails for appointments and for cancellations"": This is split correctly in output (R7 to R11), but the source quotes sometimes overlap or could be improperly cut.
        - ""integrated calendar yes, same for stylist selection, I will select the stylist for the week and those are then available for appointment on the website"" — handled in R12, R13, R14, but two of these are nearly the same.
        - ""Nancy/Jim wants the digital diary so she/he can keep track of customer demand so she/he knows when the busy times are and can allocate sufficient staff on duty"" — properly split in R17 and R18.

- **Poor Phrasing:**
    - Many requirement statements are clear, but some (like R19, R20) could be made more precise.
    - R16: ""The system shall allow the user to prepare records on their computer and email them to the accountant."" The quote ""She/he hopes to prepare records on this computer and email it to the accountant who will then prepare the tax retur"" could have been better reflected as two distinct requirements: (1) prepare on computer, (2) send via email.
    - ""no extra notification"" (R15) is vague, it is not clear precisely what is meant by ""extra.""

- **Traceability Errors:**
    - The agent sometimes used partial snippets rather than full stakeholder source sentences, particularly for multi-part sentences.
    - There is a tendency in the output to select fragments that are not pure, full sentences as the quote, sometimes resulting in ambiguous traceability.

**2. Self-Correction Strategy**

- **Primary Failure:** 
    > The main failure was an overly aggressive splitting and paraphrasing of source quotes, causing some requirements to:
    > - have insufficiently precise or incomplete 'source_quote' traceability,
    > - consist of paraphrased or partially justified requirement statements,
    > - split compound sentences in a way that loses original user intent,
    > - be redundant or unnecessarily divided.
    > Additionally, there is vagueness in mapping vague user statements to formal requirements without clear justification in the verbatim quote.

- **Correction Plan:** 
    - **Instruction on Compound Statements:** Direct the agent to treat entire stakeholder sentences or clauses as atomic unless there is an *explicit and clear* division of intent, and avoid quoting sentence fragments out of context.
    - **Clarity in Mapping:** Require that each requirement's 'statement' is completely and precisely covered by the chosen/verbatim source_quote, without extrapolation, and to err on the side of combining rather than arbitrarily splitting requirements when the stakeholder did not clearly enumerate separate needs.
    - **Redundancy/Overlap:** Explicitly instruct to avoid duplicate or overlapping requirements when they are based on the same user intent and quote.
    - **Ambiguous Phrasing:** Mandate that ambiguous user comments (""no extra notification"") be captured as non-functional requirements only if the meaning is explicit or provide the minimum formal interpretation supported by the user's exact phrase.
    - **Source_quote Integrity:** Each 'source_quote' must be the full pertinent sentence or clause from the stakeholder, not a mid-sentence or cherry-picked phrase, to maximize provenance and auditability.
    - **Consistent Format:** Keep output format, but ensure requirements are neither more granular nor more abstract than the user’s words clearly support.";The system shall provide a booking system for clients to make appointments via a website, which then helps the stakeholder to make a schedule for employees.;Offer a booking system for clients to make appointments Keep track of her/his business records (receipts, expenses, wages, GST, etc.) Keep track of supplies and notify her/him when supplies are running out and should be ordered Provide data in form of reports to run the business more efficiently;The system shall allow customers to make appointments online via a website.;I need customers to make appointments online via a website which then helps me to make a schedule for my employees;The system shall enable clients to make a specific appointment and have the option of cancelling up to 24 hours before the appointment.;just website, make a specific appointment and have the option of cancelling up to 24h before appointment.;The system shall send confirmation emails for appointments and for cancellations.;there should be confirmation mails for appointments and for cancellations;The system shall have an integrated calendar.;integrated calendar yes, same for stylist selection, I will select the stylist for the week and those are then available for appointment on the website;The system shall allow the stakeholder to select the stylist for the week and make only those stylists available for appointment on the website.;I will select the stylist for the week and those are then available for appointment on the website;The system shall not provide extra notifications and the stakeholder will handle the stylist rotation manually.;no extra notification, and I lll do the rotation manually;The system shall enable the stakeholder to prepare business records on their computer and email them to the accountant for tax return preparation.;She/he hopes to prepare records on this computer and email it to the accountant who will then prepare the tax retur;The system shall provide a digital diary to help keep track of customer demand so the stakeholder knows when the busy times are and can allocate sufficient staff on duty.;Nancy/Jim wants the digital diary so she/he can keep track of customer demand so she/he knows when the busy times are and can allocate sufficient staff on duty;The presentation of the information should always be the same, only visuals for demand please.;i dont care, presentation should always be the same the information, only visuals for demand please;The system shall provide only basic tracking and notification for when inventory items are low.;just the basics, no active inventory management currently, when something runs out we by new;The training content for the system may be provided as a video tutorial.;video is enough, no other preferene;The system should help the stakeholder run their business more efficiently and provide reports to assist with this.;I need to run my business more efficient and am convinced reports would help me;The system shall generate reports every month with customer forecast, and comparison to other cities and years.;reports every month with customer forecast, and comparison to other cities and years;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to carefully analyze an interview transcript and extract all system requirements mentioned by the speaker.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, elicit all requirements (include both functional and non-functional requirements, you do not need to specify or categorize). Your primary goal is to capture the user's needs as accurately and completely as possible.

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The original source transcript.

**Constraint: Do not elicit more than 30 requirements.** Focus only on the most critical and distinct user needs mentioned in the transcript.

**Guidelines for High-Quality Requirements:**
To ensure the requirements you extract are clear and useful, please follow these best practices:
- **Clarity:** The requirement should have only one clear interpretation.
- **Atomicity:** Each requirement should describe a single, distinct need. Avoid combining multiple ideas into one statement.
- **Completeness:** The requirement statement should be a full sentence that expresses a complete thought.
- **Source-Based:** Every requirement you list must be directly supported by a statement or a strong implication from the transcript.

**Output Format:**
You MUST produce your output as a single, valid JSON object. The root key must be ""requirements"", which contains a list of individual requirement objects. Provide only the JSON and no other commentary.

Each requirement object in the list must have the following structure:
- `id`: A simple, unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
- `statement`: The requirement text, written as a clear, formal sentence (e.g., ""The system shall..."").
- `source_quote`: A direct, verbatim quote from the transcript that justifies the requirement, ensuring traceability. Give a literal quote, not a summary or paraphrase. Make sure the quotes are verbatim from the transcript.

**Example of the required JSON structure:**
```json

**System Role:** You are an expert Requirements Analyst. Your task is to thoroughly analyze a provided interview transcript and extract every distinct system requirement mentioned or clearly implied by the stakeholder—ensuring maximum accuracy and traceability.

**Task:**
Carefully elicit all system requirements from the transcript (both functional and non-functional), focusing only on the most important and specific needs. Each requirement must be clear, atomic, and fully justified by a direct quote from the transcript.

**Context Provided:**
1. `{interview_transcript}`: The full source transcript of the requirements interview.

**Critical Instructions:**
- **Atomicity:** Each requirement must capture only one clear, distinct system need or constraint. If the stakeholder mentions several needs or objectives together, identify and separate each into its own requirement.
- **Direct Verbatim Traceability:** For every requirement, find and provide the precise, uninterrupted, verbatim quote(s) from the transcript that justify its inclusion. Do NOT use ellipses (""..."") or paraphrase, use the exact, full statement(s) as in the transcript. If necessary, cite more than one quote, or provide the full lines as they appear.
- **Source-Driven:** Do not invent requirements or infer beyond what is explicitly stated or extremely strongly implied by the stakeholder's words.
- **Inclusion of Implied Non-Functional Needs:** If the stakeholder discusses a problem or goal (such as error reduction, improved accuracy, timing, or reliability) and it's clear that the new system is expected to deliver this as a requirement, express this as an explicit system requirement, citing the exact words that reference the problem or goal.
- **Integration and Workflow:** If the transcript mentions the need for integration, streamlining, or resolving current process constraints, formulate a requirement about that integration or process improvement, as justified by the quote.
- **Distinguish Vision/Objective from Requirements:** Do not include general project goals (e.g., “improve satisfaction”) as requirements unless the stakeholder truly expresses this as something the system must *demonstrably* achieve within its operation.

**Constraints:**
- You MUST elicit no more than 30 requirements.
- Only include requirements that are directly supported by explicit statements or strong, direct implication in the transcript.

**Quality Guidelines:**
- **Clarity:** Write each requirement as a complete, stand-alone sentence, starting with “The system shall…” or a comparably precise statement.
- **Verbatim Source Quote:** Every `source_quote` must match the transcript exactly and include the full statement(s). Never use an ellipsis or combined/substituted quotes.
- **No Compound Requirements:** Split any composite requirement into individual requirements.
- **If no explicit non-functional requirements are provided by the stakeholder, do not infer. Only extract when the stakeholder makes such expectations clear.**

**Output Format:**
Return your output as a single valid JSON object, with the root key ""requirements"" containing a list of requirement objects. Do not include any commentary or extra text. Each requirement object must contain:
- `id`: A unique identifier such as ""R1"", ""R2"", etc.
- `statement`: The full, atomic requirement.
- `source_quote`: The exact, verbatim stakeholder quote(s) from the transcript that justify this requirement.

**Example:**
```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall allow clients to book appointments."",
      ""source_quote"": ""The booking system should enable clients to book appointments""
    }},
    {{
      ""id"": ""R2"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall automatically send a notification when a supply item reaches its low-stock threshold."",
      ""source_quote"": ""Providing low-stock alerts should be the highest priority, as it ensures timely reordering.""

**Begin by analyzing:**

Stakeholder: Hello
Interviewer: Hello, I'm GPTREI, your requirements elicitation assistant. Today, I will be gathering detailed information about your project needs to ensure we understand all requirements clearly. Before we begin, are you in line with the scope of this interview or do your expectations of this interview differ?
Stakeholder: Yes, I’m aligned with the scope of this interview.
Interviewer: Great to hear that! To start off, could you please introduce yourself and your connection to this project?
Stakeholder: I’m working on designing and implementing a system tailored to Nancy's/Jim’s Salon. My role is to create a digital solution to improve efficiency.
Interviewer: Thank you for that introduction. Could you describe the project in two to four sentences, highlighting its main objectives and goals?
Stakeholder: The goal is to replace manual processes with a comprehensive digital solution that enhances productivity and customer satisfaction. This includes creating a booking system for client appointments, automating business record management, tracking and managing supplies, and generating reports to improve efficiency.
Interviewer: Thank you for the overview. Let's talk about the current systems or workflows in place. Can you describe the current process or system you use for managing these tasks at Nancy's/Jim’s Salon?
Stakeholder: The salon uses a manual system: a diary for bookings and staff schedules, a cashbook for financial records, and a separate book for tracking supplies.
Interviewer: Okay, thank you for the explanation. What are the main features or functions you hope to achieve with this new digital solution for the salon?
Stakeholder: Key features include a booking system, automated record management, supply tracking with alerts, and efficiency reports.
Interviewer: So these are the features you want to have: a booking system, automated record management, supply tracking with alerts, and efficiency reports, right? Are there any other features you would like to see in this project, perhaps something that has not been the primary focus so far?
Stakeholder: At this stage, there aren’t additional features in mind.
Interviewer: Based on your description, do you think features like customer feedback collection or integration with marketing tools should also be included, or are these not a priority for now?
Stakeholder: They’re not a priority but could be considered for future development if the system proves successful and the salon wishes to expand its capabilities
Interviewer: Understood, thank you. Now, let's focus on prioritizing the features you've mentioned. Could you please tell me which of these features—the booking system, automated record management, supply tracking with alerts, and efficiency reports—are most critical to prioritize in the development phase?
Stakeholder: The booking system and automated record management are the highest priorities.
Interviewer: Thank you for clarifying the priorities. Let's dive into the detailed requirements for the booking system. Could you please elaborate on what you want this booking system to accomplish and any specific functionalities it should include?
Stakeholder: The booking system should enable clients to book appointments, view availability, choose hairdressers, manage waitlists, and sync with the digital diary for efficient staff scheduling.
Interviewer: Thank you for outlining that. Can you describe any existing systems or tools that are currently in use for these booking tasks and how they interact with other processes at the salon?
Stakeholder: The manual reservation diary is used for bookings, staff scheduling, and business record-keeping, but lacks integration with other processes.
Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Based on what you've described, what priority level would you assign to the different functionalities within the booking system, such as client booking, availability viewing, hairdresser selection, waitlist management, and digital diary syncing?
Stakeholder: Client booking and digital diary syncing are the highest priorities, followed by availability viewing and hairdresser selection, with waitlist management being the lowest priority initially.
Interviewer: Great, that gives us a clear direction. Moving on to the automated record management, could you please elaborate on what functionalities or goals you would like this feature to accomplish?
Stakeholder: Automated record management should handle receipts, expenses and wages
Interviewer: Thank you for detailing those components. Could you explain how you envision this automated record management system integrating or interacting with the current financial record-keeping process?
Stakeholder: he automated system would replace the manual cashbook by syncing data from bookings and staff schedules, streamlining financial tracking and generating real-time reports for the accountant.
Interviewer: That sounds efficient. In terms of priority, would you say that tracking receipts, expenses, and wages should be tackled in that order, or is there a different prioritization you have in mind for this feature?
Stakeholder: Tracking receipts is the highest priority, followed by expenses and wages.
Interviewer: Understood, thanks for clarifying. Before we move on to other features, is there any additional detail or requirement for either the booking system or automated record management that you think we've overlooked?
Stakeholder: No.
Interviewer: Perfect. Let's now discuss the supply tracking feature. Can you describe what you want this system to accomplish and any specific functionalities it should include?
Stakeholder: The supply tracking system should monitor stock levels and provide low-stock alerts
Interviewer: Thank you. How do you currently track supplies at the salon, and are there any challenges with the existing method that the new system should address?
Stakeholder: Supplies are currently tracked manually in a separate book. The main challenges include inaccurate tracking, delayed reordering, and difficulty managing stock levels.
Interviewer: I see, those are important issues to address. Could you prioritize between the functionalities within the supply tracking system, such as monitoring stock levels versus providing low-stock alerts?
Stakeholder: Providing low-stock alerts should be the highest priority, as it ensures timely reordering. Monitoring stock levels can follow as a complementary functionality.
Interviewer: Thank you for setting the priorities. Now let's move on to efficiency reports. What specific insights or data points would you like these reports to provide for improving salon operations?
Stakeholder: Efficiency reports should provide insights into appointment trends, staff performance, revenue, and peak times for improved decision-making.
Interviewer: Those insights are very valuable. How frequently would you like these reports to be generated, and who will be the primary users of these reports at the salon?
Stakeholder: weekly or monthly. The primary users will be Nancy/Jim and the management team
Interviewer: Thank you for specifying the usage and frequency. Before we conclude, is there anything else about the efficiency reports or any additional details for the other features that we should discuss?
Stakeholder: No.
Interviewer: Great, thank you for all the detailed information. To wrap up, who else do you think has valuable insights into the project, and whose needs need to be considered in this development process?
Stakeholder: The part-time staff and clients may provide valuable insights.
Interviewer: Thank you for pointing that out. Understanding their perspectives will definitely help in creating a comprehensive solution. As we close our interview, could you share what you think would constitute a successful deployment of this system at the salon?
Stakeholder: A successful deployment would streamline operations, reduce manual processes and improve staff and client satisfaction.
Interviewer: That sounds like a solid vision for success. To summarize our discussion today, we identified a booking system and automated record management as top priorities, with a focus on client booking and receipt tracking. We also explored supply tracking with low-stock alerts and efficiency reports to guide decision-making. Is there anything else you'd like to add before we finish?
Stakeholder: no
Interviewer: Thank you for your valuable insights. We will follow up with any additional questions or clarifications needed. Based on our discussion, I will prepare a detailed summary and share it with you for review. Have a great day!
```";"**Step 1: Gap Analysis**

**A. Missing Requirements**
- **Integration Requirement**: The transcript explicitly states, ""The manual reservation diary is used for bookings, staff scheduling, and business record-keeping, but lacks integration with other processes."" However, there is no atomic requirement in the list such as ""The system shall integrate booking, staff scheduling, and business record-keeping functionalities.""
- **Manual System Constraints/Problems**: The transcript contains an explicit mention that current manual methods are a limitation (e.g., ""Supplies are currently tracked manually in a separate book. The main challenges include inaccurate tracking, delayed reordering, and difficulty managing stock levels.""). While R14 partially addresses this, it doesn’t specifically capture all main challenges as requirements, such as ""The system shall reduce delays in supply reordering"" or ""The system shall minimize difficulty managing stock levels.""
- **No requirements address the limitation of lack of feature integration** pointed out by the user.
- **No explicit requirement ensures regular/automated syncing between records and diaries, only that it's possible.**
- **No explicit non-functional requirements beyond general aims for satisfaction and streamlined workflow**: There’s mention of “real-time” (e.g., reports, record management), but nothing concretely captured about system performance, usability, security, or reliability - even when the stakeholder discusses error reduction and improved accuracy.

**B. Misinterpreted Requirements**
- **R6**: ""The system shall offer real-time automated management of business records."" The quote is ""This includes... automating business record management"". Stakeholder does not reference ""real-time"" here, the word ""real-time"" is introduced in R6 and not truly justified by the quote.
- **R10**: “The system shall replace the manual cashbook by synchronizing data from bookings and staff schedules for financial tracking.” The source quote starts “he automated system would replace…” but should be “The” (possible minor typo), but still close. However, combining replacement *and* synchronization makes it potentially compound.

**C. Compound Requirements**
- **R14**: “The system shall maintain accurate, up-to-date supply tracking to eliminate errors of the manual process.” The source quote discusses three challenges: “inaccurate tracking, delayed reordering, and difficulty managing stock levels.” This requirement combines multiple improvements.
- **R21** & **R28**: Both reference streamlining, reducing manual processes and improving satisfaction. These conflate several distinct quality goals (operational efficiency, manual workload reduction, and stakeholder satisfaction) into one.

**D. Poor Phrasing**
- Several requirements are generic or vague, such as:
  - **R6**: “real-time automated management”—does not specify what ""real-time"" means or which records.
  - **R21, R28**: “Streamline operations, reduce manual processes, and improve satisfaction” is closer to a vision or high-level goal than a precise requirement.

**E. Traceability Errors**
- **R6** improperly introduces “real-time,” which is not quoted.
- **R11** says ""generate real-time financial reports,"" but the quote is ""generating real-time reports for the accountant."" This is more justified, but the meaning of ""real-time"" isn’t clarified in the transcript for all report types.
- **Many requirements use ellipses** (""..."") in `source_quote`, which is not truly a verbatim quote from the transcript as required by the instructions.

**Summary of Primary Failure:**
The main failures of the previous prompt and output are:
- **Lack of strict atomicity and granularity**: Several requirements combine multiple ideas, losing specificity.
- **Loose adherence to verbatim quoting**: Many `source_quote` fields are not strictly verbatim, using ellipses or partial/edited lines.
- **Incomplete extraction**: Several implied or directly stated requirements (e.g., integration, reduction of specific manual process errors, performance/accuracy, constraints of the current system, and explicit consideration of non-functional requirements where implied) are missing.
- **Poor distinction between high-level project goals and actual system requirements**: Statements such as improving staff/client satisfaction are presented as requirements rather than as project objectives.

**Step 2: Strategy for Improved Prompt**
To address these failures, the next prompt must:
- Instruct the analyst to:
  - **Strictly use verbatim source quotes without ellipses or paraphrasing.** Quotes must match exactly, or span multiple lines, if needed.
  - **Disaggregate any compound requirements** into their atomic components—each requirement must be only one behavior or property.
  - **Include requirements for implied non-functional needs** if specifics are discussed or strongly implied (e.g., accuracy, error reduction, usability, system reliability/performance).
  - **Exclude high-level goals from the requirements** unless the transcript expresses an explicit requirement for the system to *demonstrate* those goals in some measurable way.
  - **Include requirements about integration, reduction of manual process problems, and other current-system pain points, if the transcript mentions these as explicit needs.**
  - **If performance or quality characteristics (e.g., ""real-time"") are not directly in the quote, do not add them.**
- Provide explicit reminders and examples in the prompt for: verbatim quoting, atomicity, separating high-level goals from real requirements, and what to do with implied requirements.
- Explicitly instruct to avoid ellipses (""..."") or summarized/partial quotes in `source_quote`.

**System Role:** You are an expert Requirements Analyst. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the provided interview transcript and extract every distinct system requirement explicitly stated or strongly implied by the stakeholder—ensuring atomicity, non-functional coverage, accuracy, and rigorous verbatim traceability.

**Task:**  
Review the transcript below. Meticulously elicit all system requirements (functional and non-functional) mentioned or clearly implied by the stakeholder. Your output should capture process improvements, user-facing features, automation goals, and any expectations regarding accuracy, timeliness, reliability, integration, and reduction of manual processes. Include all relevant user roles. Where the stakeholder identifies a deficiency or challenge (such as errors, delays, or inefficiency), express these as explicit non-functional requirements, with the exact language used to justify the requirement.

**Instructions:**  
- **Atomicity:** Every requirement must describe a single, distinct system need or constraint. If any statement in the transcript contains multiple needs/problems/objectives, extract each as an individual requirement.
- **Direct Verbatim Traceability:** For every requirement, provide the precise, uninterrupted transcript quote(s) that directly justify the requirement. Always use the full relevant sentences/lines as they appear. Do NOT use ellipses (""...""), combine quotes from disparate transcript sections, nor paraphrase. Multiple adjacent complete lines may be cited if necessary for context.
- **Non-Functional & Process Improvement Coverage:** When the stakeholder mentions challenges (such as inaccuracy, delayed reordering, manual errors, lack of integration, inefficiency), extract these as explicit non-functional requirements or process improvement requirements, precisely using the relevant transcript language.
- **Explicit Automation and Replacement:** Whenever the stakeholder discusses automating, streamlining, or replacing manual processes, extract a standalone requirement regarding this specific automation or replacement, justified by their words.
- **User Roles:** If the stakeholder refers to specific user roles or perspectives that are important for the system or its outputs, include a requirement referencing system support for these user roles.
- **No Compound Requirements:** Do not combine multiple requirements into one statement. If a transcript line contains multiple objectives or problems, split into separate requirement statements with their respective quotes.
- **Precise Feature Phrasing:** Use clear, unambiguous verbs such as ""allow"", ""automate"", ""notify"", ""replace"", ""integrate"", ""track"" as justified by the transcript. Avoid vague terms like ""provide"" unless that is the verb used by the stakeholder.
- **No Invention:** Do not infer needs beyond what is explicitly stated or very strongly implied in the transcript.  
- **No General Goals:** Do not include general project goals (such as ""improve satisfaction"") as system requirements unless the stakeholder specifically asks the system to achieve these through functionality.
- **Constraints:**  
    - Elicit a maximum of 30 requirements.  
    - Only include requirements directly supported by the transcript.

**Quality Guidelines:**  
- **Clarity:** Write each requirement as a stand-alone sentence, beginning with “The system shall…” or a comparably precise phrase.
- **Verbatim Source Quote:** Each requirement's `source_quote` must perfectly match the transcript and consist of complete, uninterrupted sentence(s) or line(s).  
- **Output Format:**  
Return your output as a single valid JSON object, with the root key ""requirements"" containing a list of requirement objects.  
Each object must have:  
  - `id`: A unique identifier (""R1"", ""R2"", etc.)
  - `statement`: The full, atomic requirement.
  - `source_quote`: The exact, verbatim transcript quote(s) justifying the requirement.

**Example:**  
```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall allow clients to book appointments."",
      ""source_quote"": ""The booking system should enable clients to book appointments""

Interviewer: Thank you for setting the priorities. Now let's move on to efficiency reports. What specific insights or data points would you like these reports to provide for improving salon operations?  
Stakeholder: Efficiency reports should provide insights into appointment trends, staff performance, revenue, and peak times for improved decision-making.  
Interviewer: Those insights are very valuable. How frequently would you like these reports to be generated, and who will be the primary users of these reports at the salon?  
Stakeholder: weekly or monthly. The primary users will be Nancy/Jim and the management team  
Interviewer: Thank you for specifying the usage and frequency. Before we conclude, is there anything else about the efficiency reports or any additional details for the other features that we should discuss?  
Stakeholder: No.  
Interviewer: Great, thank you for all the detailed information. To wrap up, who else do you think has valuable insights into the project, and whose needs need to be considered in this development process?  
Stakeholder: The part-time staff and clients may provide valuable insights.  
Interviewer: Thank you for pointing that out. Understanding their perspectives will definitely help in creating a comprehensive solution. As we close our interview, could you share what you think would constitute a successful deployment of this system at the salon?  
Stakeholder: A successful deployment would streamline operations, reduce manual processes and improve staff and client satisfaction.  
Interviewer: That sounds like a solid vision for success. To summarize our discussion today, we identified a booking system and automated record management as top priorities, with a focus on client booking and receipt tracking. We also explored supply tracking with low-stock alerts and efficiency reports to guide decision-making. Is there anything else you'd like to add before we finish?  
Stakeholder: no  
Interviewer: Thank you for your valuable insights. We will follow up with any additional questions or clarifications needed. Based on our discussion, I will prepare a detailed summary and share it with you for review. Have a great day!

**Step 1: Gap Analysis**

**Missing Requirements:**
1. **Reduction of Manual Processes / Error Reduction:** The transcript repeatedly references replacing manual systems, reducing errors and inaccuracies (""The main challenges include inaccurate tracking...""), and streamlining workflow, but requirements regarding these objectives are not explicitly and atomically stated in the output. For example, ""streamlining operations"" or reducing manual effort is referenced but not included as atomic requirements.
2. **Implied Non-Functional - Accuracy/Timeliness:** Issues such as ""inaccurate tracking"" and ""delayed reordering"" are mentioned, justifying non-functional needs for improved tracking accuracy and timely notifications. These are not extracted as explicit system requirements.
3. **Implied User Roles:** Stakeholder mentions ""part-time staff and clients may provide valuable insights."" There's no requirement addressing access or consideration of these user types or their perspectives in the system.
4. **Replacement/Integration Requirements:** Statements such as ""replace the manual reservation diary"" and ""replace the manual cashbook by syncing data"" are sometimes included as compound requirements. However, the explicit need for ""integration"" is often bundled, and the necessity for ""no longer requiring manual record books"" is not always atomically extracted.
5. **Streamline Operations:** The aim to ""streamline operations"" is mentioned as a success metric but could justify an atomic requirement about process automation or reduction of manual effort.
6. **Expansion/Future Capability:** While future features like ""customer feedback collection"" are discussed for later, a requirement stating ""the system shall be extensible to support future feature integration"" (strongly implied) is missing.

**Misinterpreted Requirements:**
- Several requirements use general phrases such as ""provide"" or ""manage"" that are imprecise. For example, ""The system shall provide automated business record management"" is vague, more precise wording such as ""The system shall automatically manage business records, including receipts, expenses, and wages"" (with a clear scope) increases clarity.
- Sometimes, requirement statements are too compound (e.g., integrating booking, staff, and record-keeping in one requirement).

**Compound Requirements:**
- E.g., ""The system shall replace the manual reservation diary and provide integration for bookings, staff scheduling, and record-keeping."" should be split into (a) replacing the diary and (b) integrating the processes.
- ""The system shall provide supply tracking with alerts."" and ""The system shall allow monitoring of stock levels for all supplies."" partially overlap.

**Poor Phrasing:**
- Requirements often use ""provide"" (a system-level objective) rather than specifying the atomic user-facing action or feature.
- Non-functional needs (timeliness, accuracy) are not drawn out with explicit statements.
- Some requirements do not specify the scope (e.g., ""generate reports to improve efficiency"" should specify the report type and contents as justified by the transcript).

**Traceability Errors:**
- Several ""source_quote"" fields use only excerpts or partial sentences extracted from compound transcript statements, and sometimes they are spliced from multiple ideas, risking loss of verbatim context. Some use partial sentences or include ellipses (or combined quotes), some are close, but not perfect matches.
- The quote for R28/R29 (""weekly or monthly. The primary users will be Nancy/Jim and the management team"") is ambiguous, as it lumps frequency and users into a single quote, making atomic mapping harder.

---

**Step 2: Formulate an Improvement Strategy & Focus on Self-Correction**

**Primary Failure Identified:**  
The main failure was the inadequate and incomplete extraction of non-functional and process improvement requirements relating to accuracy, timeliness, error reduction, and explicit replacement of manual processes. Additionally, requirements were sometimes compound or vaguely phrased, and some verbatim traceability was imperfect, with source quotes extracted in fragments or not atomically tied to single requirements.

**Improvement Strategy:**  
- Explicitly instruct the requirements analyst agent to extract all non-functional requirements, including any mention of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, or error reduction, wherever the stakeholder links these to a process deficiency or goal for the new system.  
- Reaffirm the atomicity constraint, with added guidance emphasizing the need to split requirements when the transcript couples needs/problems with outcomes (e.g., ""inaccurate tracking"" and ""timely reordering"" → two requirements).
- Give specific instructions to never use partial sentence-fragments, but to always select the complete relevant line(s), even if they must include several adjacent lines.
- Add an explicit note to look for replacement of manual processes, and to extract requirements about automation, improved integration, and reduction of manual effort whenever the stakeholder mensions them as a reason or outcome for the system.
- Direct the agent to include any user role or perspective that the stakeholder identifies as relevant.
- Warn against vague verbs: instruct to use clear action/feature statements (""manage"", ""allow"", ""automate"", ""notify"", ""replace"") directly as intended by the transcript.
- Retain strict output format and ensure that each requirement is paired with a perfect verbatim quote.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to meticulously analyze an interview transcript and extract all system requirements explicitly stated or strongly implied by the speakers.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, elicit all requirements (including both functional and non-functional). Your primary goal is to capture every distinct, actionable user need as accurately and completely as possible.

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The original source transcript.

**Constraint:** Do not elicit more than 30 requirements. Focus only on the most critical and clearly distinct user needs mentioned or implied in the transcript.

**Critical Instructions for High-Quality Requirements Extraction:**
To maximize the completeness, clarity, and usefulness of extracted requirements:
- **Verbatim Citation:** Every requirement MUST include a `source_quote` that is a literal, unedited, word-for-word phrase or sentence from the transcript. Do NOT use ellipses or paraphrased summaries.
- **Atomicity:** Each requirement MUST address a single feature, capability, role, or data entity. Do NOT combine more than one distinct concept, user type, data type, or process in any single requirement.
- **Clarity & Actionability:** Each requirement MUST be clearly stated as a system feature or property (not as an abstract business benefit unless a direct feature is not derivable).
- **Avoid Duplication:** Do NOT list requirements that overlap in scope or intent. Each should be unique and non-redundant.
- **Staff/Admin Features:** Explicitly extract requirements for staff/admin side features or dashboards wherever mentioned or implied.
- **Process Improvements:** If the transcript describes the elimination of existing manual or phone/fax-based operations, capture requirements about automating/replacing these processes.
- **Implementation Constraints:** If urgency, deadlines, or implementation schedules are stated or implied by the stakeholder, capture them as requirements.
- **Security/Compliance:** If new integrations (like online payments) are mentioned as ""entirely new"", consider requirements about secure, robust, or compliant implementations where relevant.
- **Implied Requirements:** If a clear user desire or business need is only strongly implied (not explicitly stated), you may include as a requirement, but the `source_quote` must clearly suggest this need.
- **No Combined Entities:** Do NOT combine requirements that reference different roles (e.g., customer and staff), different data types (e.g., reservations and inventory), or different system areas (e.g., inventory and booking) into a single requirement.
- **Translate Outcomes to Features:** If an outcome or benefit (e.g., ""improve coordination"") is stated, create a requirement specifying the system capability or feature that directly enables this benefit, using appropriate source quotes.

**Mandatory Output Format:**
You MUST produce your output as a single, valid JSON object. The root key must be ""requirements"", which contains a list of individual requirement objects.

Each requirement object in the list must have the following structure:
- `id`: A unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"", ...).
- `statement`: The requirement text, written as a clear, formal sentence (e.g., ""The system shall..."").
- `source_quote`: A direct, verbatim quote from the transcript that justifies the requirement, ensuring traceability. Use only literal word-for-word text.

**Your output MUST be ONLY the JSON, and nothing else.**

**Begin with the given transcript:**

Stakeholder: Hello
Interviewer: Hello, I'm GPTREI, your requirements elicitation assistant. Today, I will be gathering detailed information about your project needs to ensure we understand all requirements clearly. Before we begin, are you in line with the scope of this interview, or do your expectations of this interview differ?
Stakeholder: Can you explain it in short to me again
Interviewer: Certainly! I'm here to ask questions and gather information about your project needs to ensure we clearly understand all the requirements. Does this align with what you expect from this interview?
Stakeholder: Yes
Interviewer: Great! To start off, could you please introduce yourself and your connection to this project?
Stakeholder: I am Jim the owner of the ski resorts
Interviewer: Thank you, Jim, for the introduction. How would you describe this project in two to four sentences?
Stakeholder: Please come to an end
Stakeholder: This project involves developing an innovative online system for Cool Ski Resorts, enabling hotel reservations, ski equipment hire, and class bookings through a user-friendly website. The system will integrate with social media platforms for promotion and connect to a centralized database to manage reservations, bookings, and inventory across all three resorts. This digital solution will streamline operations, improve coordination, and increase visibility, helping the business reach a larger customer base. Additionally, customers will be able to check weather and snow conditions at the resorts in real-time.
Interviewer: Thank you for the detailed description, Jim. Now, let's talk a bit about the systems and workflows you currently use. Can you describe the current process or system you use for handling hotel reservations, ski equipment hire, and class bookings at your resorts?
Stakeholder: Currently, Cool Ski Resorts handles hotel reservations, ski equipment hire, and class bookings through a simple, semi-manual process that relies on telephone and fax communication. Each resort maintains a local database to store reservation details, and payments are processed manually on-site with the assistance of staff. The coordination between the three resorts is limited, which increases the workload for the staff managing accounts, customer service, and inventory at each location. This setup is functional but lacks the efficiency and broad visibility that a digital system could provide.
Interviewer: Thank you for explaining the current process. What current processes do you want to change/improve, or what are the features you hope to get from this project?
Stakeholder: These 5 things to be exact An aesthetically pleasing and intuitive website for customers to see what is available in each resort Online hotel reservation, hiring, and booking training classes Inventory management Promotion and advertisement through social media Query weather and snow condition forecasts for customers staying at the resort
Interviewer: Got it. So, the features you're looking for are an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive website, online hotel reservations along with hiring and booking training classes, inventory management, social media promotion and advertisement, and querying weather and snow condition forecasts. Are there any other features you would like to see in this project, perhaps something that has not been the primary focus so far?
Stakeholder: No not for now
Interviewer: Understood. Based on your description, do you think including online customer support or chat options might be beneficial for addressing any immediate inquiries or issues that guests might have?
Stakeholder: Yes sounds very good
Interviewer: Great! Now that we've identified the main features, let's prioritize them. Which of these features would you consider the highest priority for your business?
Stakeholder: Online hotel reservation, hiring, and booking training classes
Interviewer: Thank you for prioritizing the features. Could you please elaborate on what you want the online hotel reservation, hiring, and class booking system to accomplish? For example, details about user experience, ease of access, or specific functionalities?
Stakeholder: Users/Customers should be able to book comfortably from home, without having to call someone or wait in a phone line
Interviewer: That makes sense. So, you want a seamless and efficient booking experience for users from home without needing to wait or call. Could you describe more about the specific functionalities you envision for this feature, such as how you would handle payment processing or user notifications?
Interviewer: Got it. We'll ensure that aspect is well integrated. Considering this feature's priority, when would you ideally like to see this online booking system implemented and running?
Stakeholder: Yes, online payment via different platforms credit card debit card or PayPal.
Interviewer: Thank you for specifying the payment options. Do you currently have any system in place for processing payments, or would this be an entirely new integration for your online platform?
Stakeholder: That would be entirely new
Stakeholder: Tomorrow
Interviewer: I understand the urgency! While tomorrow might not be feasible, it gives a good sense of how important this is to your business. We'll aim for the soonest possible timeline and assess the resources and steps necessary to move quickly. 

Let's look into the next feature: inventory management. Could you please elaborate on what you want this inventory management system to accomplish?
Stakeholder: Currently, each Cool Ski Resort manages its inventory manually and separately, tracking ski equipment, clothing, and items available for hire at a local level. Staff update records when items are rented, returned, or maintained, with no central system connecting the three resorts. This decentralized process makes it hard to monitor overall inventory, creates potential for errors, and limits coordination between the resorts.
Interviewer: Thank you for outlining the current inventory process. How do you envision a centralized inventory management system improving operations at your resorts? Are there specific features or functionalities you believe are essential for this system?
Stakeholder: Real time updates and data tracking, visual dashboard with past data
Interviewer: A centralized system with real-time updates, data tracking, and a visual dashboard showcasing past data sounds like it will indeed streamline your operations. Is there a particular way you'd like this information to be presented to the staff, such as through mobile devices or desktops, or both?
Interviewer: Certainly, Jim. To summarize, we discussed developing an innovative online system for Cool Ski Resorts that includes online booking, inventory management with real-time updates and a visual dashboard, social media integration, and weather condition queries. We also explored the possibility of integrating online customer support.

The highest priority is implementing the online hotel reservation, hiring, and class booking system, with payments through various online platforms.

Next steps include preparing a detailed summary and action plan for implementing these features and following up on any additional questions or clarifications you might have.

Thank you for your valuable insights. If there's anything else you'd like to add or clarify, please let me know. Otherwise, we can conclude our interview.
```";"**Step 1: Gap Analysis**
- **Missing Requirements:**
  - **Deadline/Urgency:** The stakeholder stated ""Tomorrow"" as the desired implementation date, expressing urgency, but there is no requirement covering implementation timeline or urgency in the extracted list.
  - **Manual Operations Elimination:** There is no explicit requirement to ""eliminate manual/human intervention"" in processes (e.g., avoid telephone, fax, manual payments).
  - **Payment Security or Compliance:** The transcript notes online payments as a new integration, which strongly implies a need for payment security/compliance. This is a common implied requirement in such a domain but not captured.
  - **Transition from Manual to Automated Systems:** The context about eliminating errors and inefficiencies of current manual methods is not directly stated as a requirement to automate former manual/telephone/fax processes.
  - **Staff-Facing Features:** Details about ""the staff managing accounts, customer service, and inventory"" hint at possible staff-facing functionality or admin dashboards, but these are insufficiently specified in the list.
  - **Scalability / Future-proofing:** No mention or implication around the ability to add new resorts or scale operations, despite emphasis on ""reaching a larger customer base.""
  - **Audit/History:** The dashboard requirement covers ""past data,"" but does not clearly require ""audit trails/history"" for bookings or user actions.
  - **Accessibility:** There is an explicit mention of ""comfortably from home,"" but no mention of requirements around accessibility or responsiveness beyond ""user-friendly.""

- **Misinterpreted Requirements:**
  - Most requirements align closely with the provided transcripts, however, some overgeneralize partial quotes. For example, ""The system shall allow staff to track reservations, bookings, and inventory centrally"" (R19) is a restatement of R7, resulting in duplication, not truly distinct needs.
  - Requirement R16, ""The system shall streamline operations and improve coordination between the three resorts,"" is more a statement of business benefit rather than a system requirement, unless rephrased into actionable functions.
  - R17, ""increase the online visibility...to reach a larger customer base,"" is again an outcome, not a system feature or capability.

- **Compound Requirements:**
  - Several requirements try to combine multiple aspects, e.g. R7 covers ""reservations, bookings, and inventory,"" which could be three separate items.
  - R5 (""display the availability of accommodations, equipment, and classes at each resort"") conglomerates three entities (accommodations, equipment, classes) into one, which limits atomicity.

- **Poor Phrasing:**
  - Many requirements start with ""The system shall..."" but sometimes combine desired benefits (outcomes) versus capabilities (features).
  - Outcomes like increased visibility (R17), improved coordination (R16) should be restated as features enabling those outcomes.
  - R20 (""The system shall be capable of being integrated with mobile devices and desktops for use by staff."") is not clearly actionable (""capable of being integrated"" is vague), better phrased as ""staff must be able to access system via mobile and desktop devices.""

- **Traceability Errors:**
  - Some `source_quote`s are not literal, or combine fragments. For example, R1's quote: ""This project involves developing an innovative online system for Cool Ski Resorts, enabling hotel reservations... through a user-friendly website."" introduces ellipsis, not a verbatim quote.
  - Several statements use paraphrases rather than exact snippets from the transcript, violating the ""verbatim"" constraint.

**Step 2: Formulate Improvement Strategy and Self-Correction**
- **Primary Failure:** The most prominent failure is the insufficient adherence to atomicity, clarity between features vs. business outcomes, and strictly verbatim traceability. Additionally, some strongly implied or explicit requirements—such as those regarding the desired elimination of manual effort, delivery urgency, and staff/admin side features—were missed. Overlaps and duplication also indicate a lack of careful atomic analysis and differentiation.
- **Correction Focus:**
  - Instruct the agent to:
    - Separate outcome-oriented expectations (like ""improve coordination,"" ""increase visibility"") from actionable, feature-based requirements or, if included, ensure they are stated as system functionalities.
    - Keep each requirement atomic (do not combine functionalities or entities in one statement).
    - Quote only literal, unedited, exact phrases from transcript (no ellipses).
    - Explicitly consider and extract requirements about urgent timelines, reduction of manual steps, staff/admin features, and other implementation details implied by the user statements.
    - Remove duplicate/overlapping requirements.
    - Add a bullet about avoiding combining different roles, data entities, or capabilities into a single requirement.
    - Make the difference between feature and outcome clear—if a business outcome is stated, the AI should translate it into a system behavior or capability.";The system shall provide an online

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to meticulously analyze an interview transcript and extract all system requirements explicitly stated or strongly implied by the stakeholder.

**Task:**  
From the provided interview transcript, elicit *all* requirements, both functional and non-functional. Your primary objectives are to ensure that each requirement is precisely atomic (no compound statements), unmistakably justified with a literal quote, and clearly mapped to a single feature, user role, or data entity. Focus on separating requirements by user type, data type, and system area as necessary.

**Critical Instructions for High-Quality Requirements Extraction:**

1. **Atomicity and Separation:**  
   - *Every* requirement must represent exactly **one** feature, user story, user role, workflow action, or data entity.  
   - Do **not** combine more than one kind of user, data type, or process.  
   - For example, if customers and staff both need dashboards, write these as separate requirements using distinct quotes.

2. **Verbatim, Traceable Source:**  
   - Each requirement must include a `source_quote` field that is a *literal, unedited* phrase or sentence taken directly from the transcript, preferably from the stakeholder.  
   - Do *not* use composite or paraphrased quotes, ellipses, interviewer questions, or summary conclusions unless such is the only clear indicator of an implied requirement.

3. **Implied Requirements:**  
   - If a user need or business driver is only *strongly implied* and not stated verbatim by the stakeholder, you may create a requirement, but:  
     - Clearly mark the requirement as ""implied"" in its `statement` by prefacing with ""[Implied]"".  
     - Use the most relevant verbatim quote that suggests the need as the `source_quote`.
     - Provide only if the implication is quite direct and necessary for system completeness (e.g., security for a new payment integration).

4. **Non-Functional Requirements:**  
   - Explicitly extract any requirements related to usability, user experience (e.g., ""user-friendly"", ""book comfortably from home""), performance, platform, or device compatibility if they appear in the transcript.
   - Treat mentions like ""aesthetically pleasing and intuitive"", ""user-friendly"", or ""comfortably from home"" as separate non-functional requirements with their own atomic statements.

5. **Staff/Admin-Side Features:**  
   - Any reference to features, dashboards, access, workflows, or data needs for staff or admin users must be extracted as their own requirements, never combined with customer or general system requirements.

6. **Process Improvements and Manual Replacements:**  
   - Whenever old processes (such as phone, fax, or manual on-site payment) are described, create explicit requirements to automate or replace each such workflow—separately for reservations, bookings, equipment hire, payments, etc.

7. **Implementation Constraints and Urgency:**  
   - If implementation timeline, deadlines, or urgency are asserted by the stakeholder (e.g., ""Tomorrow""), create a requirement stating the need for expedited delivery, but only if traceable to their literal phrase and only for the scope implied.

8. **Security, Compliance, and Robustness:**  
   - If new system integrations (such as online payments) are described as ""entirely new"", infer implied requirements for security, compliance, and robustness as atomic requirements, using the most relevant stakeholder quote, and mark these as [Implied].

9. **No Duplicates or Compound Requirements:**  
   - Each requirement must stand alone: do not list requirements that overlap in scope or intent.
   - Do not repeat the same need in different words.
   - Never combine different roles, data, or workflows in a single requirement.

10. **Avoid Benefit-Only Requirements:**  
    - Translate outcomes or broad business benefits (“improve coordination”, “increase visibility”) into corresponding system features or capabilities.  
    - For example, a quote about improving coordination should yield a requirement for a centralized coordination feature or data-sharing capability.

**Mandatory Output Format:**  
You must output your requirements as a *single valid* JSON object with the root key ""requirements"", which contains an ordered list of requirement objects.  
Each requirement object *must* have:

- `id`: A unique identifier (""R1"", ""R2"", etc.).
- `statement`: The requirement statement, as a single clear, formal sentence (prefixed with [Implied] if inferred).
- `source_quote`: A direct, verbatim phrase or sentence from the transcript as traceability.

*You must ONLY output the JSON object, and nothing else.*

**Example Output (format only):**
```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall provide a customer-facing booking interface."",
      ""source_quote"": ""Users/Customers should be able to book comfortably from home, without having to call someone or wait in a phone line""
    }},
    {{
      ""id"": ""R2"",
      ""statement"": ""[Implied] The system shall implement secure processing for online payment transactions."",
      ""source_quote"": ""That would be entirely new""

**Begin the requirements extraction using this interview transcript:**

Stakeholder: Hello  
Interviewer: Hello, I'm GPTREI, your requirements elicitation assistant. Today, I will be gathering detailed information about your project needs to ensure we understand all requirements clearly. Before we begin, are you in line with the scope of this interview, or do your expectations of this interview differ?  
Stakeholder: Can you explain it in short to me again  
Interviewer: Certainly! I'm here to ask questions and gather information about your project needs to ensure we clearly understand all the requirements. Does this align with what you expect from this interview?  
Stakeholder: Yes  
Interviewer: Great! To start off, could you please introduce yourself and your connection to this project?  
Stakeholder: I am Jim the owner of the ski resorts  
Interviewer: Thank you, Jim, for the introduction. How would you describe this project in two to four sentences?  
Stakeholder: Please come to an end  
Stakeholder: This project involves developing an innovative online system for Cool Ski Resorts, enabling hotel reservations, ski equipment hire, and class bookings through a user-friendly website. The system will integrate with social media platforms for promotion and connect to a centralized database to manage reservations, bookings, and inventory across all three resorts. This digital solution will streamline operations, improve coordination, and increase visibility, helping the business reach a larger customer base. Additionally, customers will be able to check weather and snow conditions at the resorts in real-time.  
Interviewer: Thank you for the detailed description, Jim. Now, let's talk a bit about the systems and workflows you currently use. Can you describe the current process or system you use for handling hotel reservations, ski equipment hire, and class bookings at your resorts?  
Stakeholder: Currently, Cool Ski Resorts handles hotel reservations, ski equipment hire, and class bookings through a simple, semi-manual process that relies on telephone and fax communication. Each resort maintains a local database to store reservation details, and payments are processed manually on-site with the assistance of staff. The coordination between the three resorts is limited, which increases the workload for the staff managing accounts, customer service, and inventory at each location. This setup is functional but lacks the efficiency and broad visibility that a digital system could provide.  
Interviewer: Thank you for explaining the current process. What current processes do you want to change/improve, or what are the features you hope to get from this project?  
Stakeholder: These 5 things to be exact An aesthetically pleasing and intuitive website for customers to see what is available in each resort Online hotel reservation, hiring, and booking training classes Inventory management Promotion and advertisement through social media Query weather and snow condition forecasts for customers staying at the resort  
Interviewer: Got it. So, the features you're looking for are an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive website, online hotel reservations along with hiring and booking training classes, inventory management, social media promotion and advertisement, and querying weather and snow condition forecasts. Are there any other features you would like to see in this project, perhaps something that has not been the primary focus so far?  
Stakeholder: No not for now  
Interviewer: Understood. Based on your description, do you think including online customer support or chat options might be beneficial for addressing any immediate inquiries or issues that guests might have?  
Stakeholder: Yes sounds very good  
Interviewer: Great! Now that we've identified the main features, let's prioritize them. Which of these features would you consider the highest priority for your business?  
Stakeholder: Online hotel reservation, hiring, and booking training classes  
Interviewer: Thank you for prioritizing the features. Could you please elaborate on what you want the online hotel reservation, hiring, and class booking system to accomplish? For example, details about user experience, ease of access, or specific functionalities?  
Stakeholder: Users/Customers should be able to book comfortably from home, without having to call someone or wait in a phone line  
Interviewer: That makes sense. So, you want a seamless and efficient booking experience for users from home without needing to wait or call. Could you describe more about the specific functionalities you envision for this feature, such as how you would handle payment processing or user notifications?  
Interviewer: Got it. We'll ensure that aspect is well integrated. Considering this feature's priority, when would you ideally like to see this online booking system implemented and running?  
Stakeholder: Yes, online payment via different platforms credit card debit card or PayPal.  
Interviewer: Thank you for specifying the payment options. Do you currently have any system in place for processing payments, or would this be an entirely new integration for your online platform?  
Stakeholder: That would be entirely new  
Stakeholder: Tomorrow  
Interviewer: I understand the urgency! While tomorrow might not be feasible, it gives a good sense of how important this is to your business. We'll aim for the soonest possible timeline and assess the resources and steps necessary to move quickly.  

Let's look into the next feature: inventory management. Could you please elaborate on what you want this inventory management system to accomplish?  
Stakeholder: Currently, each Cool Ski Resort manages its inventory manually and separately, tracking ski equipment, clothing, and items available for hire at a local level. Staff update records when items are rented, returned, or maintained, with no central system connecting the three resorts. This decentralized process makes it hard to monitor overall inventory, creates potential for errors, and limits coordination between the resorts.  
Interviewer: Thank you for outlining the current inventory process. How do you envision a centralized inventory management system improving operations at your resorts? Are there specific features or functionalities you believe are essential for this system?  
Stakeholder: Real time updates and data tracking, visual dashboard with past data  
Interviewer: A centralized system with real-time updates, data tracking, and a visual dashboard showcasing past data sounds like it will indeed streamline your operations. Is there a particular way you'd like this information to be presented to the staff, such as through mobile devices or desktops, or both?  
Interviewer: Certainly, Jim. To summarize, we discussed developing an innovative online system for Cool Ski Resorts that includes online booking, inventory management with real-time updates and a visual dashboard, social media integration, and weather condition queries. We also explored the possibility of integrating online customer support.  

The highest priority is implementing the online hotel reservation, hiring, and class booking system, with payments through various online platforms.  

Next steps include preparing a detailed summary and action plan for implementing these features and following up on any additional questions or clarifications you might have.  

Thank you for your valuable insights. If there's anything else you'd like to add or clarify, please let me know. Otherwise, we can conclude our interview.
```";"**Analysis of Previous Attempt**

**1. Missing Requirements:**
- **Explicit Role Separation**: The agent consistently failed to atomize requirements for each major user group and data type. For instance, ""The system shall allow for centralized reservation management across all three resorts"" (R7) and ""The system shall maintain a centralized database for hotel reservations"" (R8) both touch on similar database topics but fail to separate staff/admin needs versus customer-facing views.
- **User Notifications**: While R24 hints at notifications (""user notifications confirming bookings, payments, or changes in reservations""), there is no clear explicit requirement articulated from a verbatim quote about this, as the actual transcript does not provide such a phrase, the statement is manufactured from the interviewer's words, not the stakeholder's.
- **Presentation Method for Staff/Admin**: ""Is there a particular way you'd like this information to be presented to the staff, such as through mobile devices or desktops, or both?"" is only present as R20 but lacks specificity regarding which features require such presentation (e.g., booking management, inventory visualizations).
- **Atomicity for Dashboard Features and Data Types**: The agent sometimes composes requirements that lump disparate system areas together, such as R10 (""visual dashboard with past data"") and R9 (inventory management features with real-time updates for multiple actions without teasing apart the atomic operations and data types).
- **No Explicit 'Elimination' Statement**: The transcript strongly describes a need to replace the current manual/phone/fax-based workflows. While R15 (""streamline operations by automating processes currently handled by telephone and fax communication"") is present, the agent does not consistently capture this as atomic requirements for each major workflow (e.g., explicit requirement for making reservations, for equipment hire, for class bookings, and for payments—each as an atomic automation).
- **No Security or Compliance Details**: Although the prompt tells the agent to infer security/compliance needs, R6 (""using industry-standard compliance"") is constructed from inference, but it's not justified by a proper traceable verbatim quote.
- **No Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**: Statements around user experience such as performance, reliability, scalability, usability, or mobile-friendliness are not extracted, though atomic NFRs are strongly implied (e.g., ""user-friendly website"", ""book comfortably from home"").

**2. Misinterpreted Requirements:**
- **R14 (""The system shall provide online customer support with chat options for immediate inquiries or issues from guests"")**: The source_quote is only ""Yes sounds very good"", which is not adequate to justify the feature. The interviewer suggested chat support, but the stakeholder only agreed, the agent did not flag the inference as implied, nor did it keep atomicity.
- **R22 (""The implementation timeline for the online booking system shall be expedited to address urgent business needs"")**: The source_quote, ""Tomorrow"", is not sufficiently contextualized, the urgency is strongly implied but needs more careful attribution.

**3. Compound Requirements:**
- Many requirements combine user types (e.g., admin and customer) and multiple data domains (e.g., booking classes, equipment, hotel) into a single statement, such as R1 and R7.
- R11 combines inventory management and availability display for multiple item types in a single requirement.

**4. Poor Phrasing:**
- Some requirements are vague, e.g., ""streamline operations"" (R15), without explicitly stating *which* processes are automated and for whom.
- Some requirements restate a benefit (""improve visibility"", ""reduce staff workload"") rather than specify the system capability (""the system shall provide a reporting dashboard for staff..."").

**5. Traceability Errors:**
- Several `source_quote` fields are not literal, standalone complete sentences as mandated, some are fragments or contextually unclear, while others are paraphrased or manipulated from interview questions rather than stakeholder statements, which reduces traceability.

**Primary Failure:**  
The main failure was a lack of strict atomicity and insufficiently clear mapping of requirements to both literal transcript quotes and separate user/system features. The output repeatedly combined user roles, scope, or system areas, failed to explicitly state NFRs or security requirements as distinct requirements, and sometimes used weak or inappropriate verbatim quotes. Furthermore, implied requirements weren't accurately flagged or justified, and non-functional requirements were largely missing.

**Self-Correction Strategy:**  
- Enforce stronger atomicity: One requirement per feature, per role, or per data type.
- Separate requirements for customer, staff, admin, and backend/data roles wherever possible.
- Only use source_quotes that are actual, literal phrases from the transcript, prioritizing stakeholder statements over interviewer leading questions, and explicitly note which requirements are implied.
- Require Non-Functional Requirements wherever usability, performance, or similar is stated (""user-friendly"", etc.).
- Explicitly atomize replacement of old manual/phone/fax processes, not just in summary (""streamline operations"") but for each described workflow or user journey.
- Demand separation of dashboard, reporting, and device-presentation features for staff/admin, if suggested even by implication.
- Instruct the agent to state where a requirement is strongly implied and why, including the quote that led to the inference.
- For implementation constraints or urgency, instruct careful context and clear mapping to relevant system features or delivery requirements, only if properly justified.
- No overlapping, compound, or duplicative requirements.
- Output *must* remain in the same JSON object structure.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to carefully analyze an interview transcript and extract all system requirements mentioned by the speaker.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, elicit all requirements (include both functional and non-functional requirements, you do not need to specify or categorize). Your primary goal is to capture the user's needs as accurately and completely as possible.

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The original source transcript.

**Constraint: Do not elicit more than 30 requirements.** Focus only on the most critical and distinct user needs mentioned in the transcript.

**Guidelines for High-Quality Requirements:**
To ensure the requirements you extract are clear and useful, please follow these best practices:
- **Clarity:** The requirement should have only one clear interpretation.
- **Atomicity:** Each requirement should describe a single, distinct need. Avoid combining multiple ideas into one statement.
- **Completeness:** The requirement statement should be a full sentence that expresses a complete thought.
- **Source-Based:** Every requirement you list must be directly supported by a statement or a strong implication from the transcript.

**Output Format:**
You MUST produce your output as a single, valid JSON object. The root key must be ""requirements"", which contains a list of individual requirement objects. Provide only the JSON and no other commentary.

Each requirement object in the list must have the following structure:
- `id`: A simple, unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
- `statement`: The requirement text, written as a clear, formal sentence (e.g., ""The system shall..."").
- `source_quote`: A direct, verbatim quote from the transcript that justifies the requirement, ensuring traceability. Give a literal quote, not a summary or paraphrase. Make sure the quotes are verbatim from the transcript.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to meticulously analyze the interview transcript provided and extract all system requirements mentioned by the speaker.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, elicit and list all distinct system requirements—both functional and non-functional—stated or directly implied by the stakeholder. It is essential to interpret requirements strictly and conservatively: each requirement must be explicitly justified by the quoted words of the stakeholder, with no unwarranted extrapolation or assumption.

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The complete interview transcript.

**Constraint: Do not elicit more than 30 requirements.** Focus only on the most critical and truly distinct user needs mentioned in the transcript.

**Guidelines for High-Quality Requirements:**
To ensure perfect requirements extraction:
- **Atomicity:** Each requirement must capture only one specific need or feature. If a stakeholder statement expresses multiple needs (e.g., ""manage reservations and hiring""), you must split this into separate requirements with their own source quotes.
- **Verbatim Traceability:** Every requirement must be fully and directly supported by a literal, verbatim quote from the transcript that precisely justifies the requirement’s scope. Do not paraphrase or generalize the quote. The requirement statement must not extend beyond what is supported by the source quote.
- **No Compound or Merged Requirements:** If a possibility exists to split a requirement into distinct atomic needs, you must do so, with each retaining its specific quote for justification.
- **Clarity and Completeness:** The requirement must be written as a stand-alone, clear, and formal sentence (e.g., ""The system shall..."") that expresses a precise and bounded functional or non-functional need.
- **Conservative Interpretation:** If a user need is only vaguely or ambiguously referenced, do not infer additional details not explicitly in the source_quote. Avoid requirements based solely on interviewer summaries or assumptions about industry standards—use only stakeholder statements or very clear, direct implications.
- **No Duplicates:** Do not list overlapping or redundant requirements, split only when needs are distinct, but do not restate requirements in different words.
- **No assumptions:** If a possible requirement is mentioned as something to follow up on with a different stakeholder (e.g., not specified yet), do not list it as a system requirement.
- **Customer vs. Staff Clarity:** Where possible, indicate in the statement which user or role the requirement addresses, provided this distinction is clear in the quote itself.

**Output Format:**
You MUST produce your output as a single, valid JSON object. The root key must be ""requirements"", which contains a list of individual requirement objects. Provide only the JSON—no explanations, no commentary.

Each requirement object in the list must have the following structure:
- `id`: A simple, unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
- `statement`: The requirement text, written as a clear, formal sentence (e.g., ""The system shall..."").
- `source_quote`: A direct, verbatim quote from the transcript that justifies the requirement. Use only stakeholder verbatim phrases, not a summary or paraphrase.

**Example of the required JSON structure:**

Stakeholder: Hello
Interviewer: Hello! Thank you for joining me today. To get started, could you please tell me about your business and the project you are currently working on?
Stakeholder: Hello, we are running a chain of three ski resorts, that are mostly new and trying to increase our customer base. For this goal we are working on a new website which should also help us to streamline our business and help mange the resorts
Interviewer: That sounds like an exciting project! Could you tell me more about the specific goals you have for the new website? For example, how you envision it helping you increase your customer base and streamline operations across your resorts?
Stakeholder: The website should manage new reservations, hiring, the customers should be able to book training classes and in general be a tool to expose us to new customers
Interviewer: Great, it seems like the website will serve multiple purposes. Regarding reservations, how do you envision the booking process working for customers? Are there any specific features or integrations you want to include in this process, such as booking calendar synchronization, payment gateways, or customer profiles?
Stakeholder: Yes all of them, also a weather forecast for the ski resorts so the customers know what to expect at the time they are booking
Interviewer: That's a comprehensive list of features! For the weather forecast, do you have a specific third-party service or API in mind that you would like to integrate, or are you open to suggestions on reliable services? Additionally, how frequently would you like the weather information to update on the site?
Stakeholder: We have no specific third party service so we are open to suggestions. The weather infomration should be updated with each inquiry from a customer
Interviewer: Thanks for clarifying. It's helpful to know that you're open to suggestions for weather services. Moving on to the hiring functionality, how do you envision the website assisting with your hiring process? Are there specific features or workflows you envision, such as posting job listings or managing applications?
Stakeholder: Yes there should be job listings and management applications, also a centrelized database to manage accounts taxes etc in all resorts at one central location
Interviewer: Integrating job listings and a centralized database for tax and account management adds significant depth to your website’s functionality. For the centralized database, will this be primarily for internal use, or will certain features be accessible to your guests as well? Also, do you have any specific tools or software that you're already using for account and tax management that you’d like to integrate with the new system?
Stakeholder: The database is exclusivly for internal use, ecxept for the calender with opening, thats needed for customers to book a visit. I dont know which account and management software we are using, my assistant is taking care of that so maybe ask them
Interviewer: Understood, keeping the database primarily for internal use while allowing customers to access the calendar makes sense. For now, focusing on customer-facing features like the public calendar, do you have any specific requirements for how it should display information to customers? For instance, would you like it to show real-time availability, special events, or any other specific details?
Stakeholder: Real-time availability is a must, special events aren´t planed yet but the funktionality should be possible in the future, ingeneral it should be aesthetically pleasing and easy to use, we are also running out of time so we need to finish
Interviewer: Meeting your timeline is important. To ensure the website is aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly, do you have any design preferences or branding guidelines we should follow? Additionally, what is your target deadline for completing this website, and what are the key milestones leading up to that date?
Stakeholder: The website should be done in about a year, last question, after that please summarize
Interviewer: Certainly! Before summarizing, one final question: Are there any specific competitors or industry examples you admire that might influence the features, design, or functionality of your website? 

And here’s a summary based on our conversation:

Your ski resort business operates three resorts and is working on a new website aimed at increasing your customer base and streamlining operations. The key functionalities you envision include managing reservations, including training class bookings, hiring processes, and a centralized internal account and tax management database. 

You wish to integrate features such as real-time booking availability, payment gateways, and customer profiles, alongside a weather forecast tool updated per customer inquiry. Although open to suggestions on third-party services, design-wise, you prefer something aesthetically pleasing and easy to use, akin to admired industry examples yet unspecified.

While the centralized database will be for internal use, it should facilitate user-accessible features like a booking calendar. Also, while not currently planning special events, you want the future option to incorporate them. Lastly, you aim to launch the website within a year, emphasizing meeting your timeline. Does this capture your main points accurately?
Stakeholder: Yes it does
Interviewer: Great! If you have any more questions or need further assistance as you move forward with your project, feel free to reach out. Good luck with the development of your new website and the growth of your ski resorts!
```";"**1. Gap Analysis**

**A. Missing Requirements**
- **Competitor/Industry Example Inspiration:** The transcript contains the question: ""Are there any specific competitors or industry examples you admire that might influence the features, design, or functionality of your website?"", which the stakeholder does not answer. While there’s no explicit requirement to incorporate features from competitors, the prompt summary does mention ""akin to admired industry examples yet unspecified,"" which could imply benchmarking against industry standards. This is nuanced, but since no explicit examples were provided, perhaps the agent correctly omitted this.
- **Milestone Planning:** The interviewer asks about ""key milestones"" before the deadline, but no stakeholder answer is present. So, no missed requirement.
- **Staff-Side vs. Customer-Side Clarity:** Some requirements blur the line between admin and customer functionality (e.g., requirement R23 combines admin of reservations, classes, and user accounts but doesn't clearly attribute which user role each applies to). 
- **Granularity regarding ""streamline our business"":** ""Help us to streamline our business and help manage the resorts"" (early in transcript). The agent captures this as ""facilitate the streamlining..."" and ""offer administrative access...,"" but doesn't break it down into more granular operational support (such as reporting, analytics, or cross-resort management) due to lack of detail.

**B. Misinterpreted Requirements**
- **Requirement R20 (Scalability):** ""The system shall be designed with scalability to support the business as it grows."" The source quote: ""we are running a chain of three ski resorts, that are mostly new and trying to increase our customer base"" does imply future growth, though explicit scalability need is not voiced.
- **Requirement R23 (Admin functions):** ""The system shall offer administrative access for staff to manage reservations, classes, and user accounts."" The source_quote is ""help manage the resorts,"" which is less specific than the requirement statement, possibly overreaching. 
- **Requirement R25 (Integration with account/tax software):** The source quote is ""I dont know which account and management software we are using, my assistant is taking care of that so maybe ask them."" The agent interpreted this as an integration requirement, but it’s only a pointer for follow-up, not a stakeholder requirement.

**C. Compound Requirements**
- Some requirements mash multiple needs:  
    - R23 (""The system shall offer administrative access for staff to manage reservations, classes, and user accounts."") could be split into three atomic requirements (for reservations, for classes, for users).

**D. Poor Phrasing**
- Many requirement statements are clear, though some (e.g., R23, R20, R21) are either not atomic or add interpretation beyond transcript support.

**E. Traceability Errors**
- Some `source_quote` entries (""help manage the resorts"", ""we are running a chain of three ski resorts, that are mostly new and trying to increase our customer base"") do not verbatim support the full scope of the associated requirement as written, as noted above.

**2. Formulate an Improvement Strategy**
**Primary Failure:**  
The agent’s principal failure was creating several compound requirements and, at times, extrapolating or over-interpreting the transcript. There is also a subtle issue with traceability—some requirement statements go beyond what’s literally justified by the verbatim ""source_quote"". Atomicity and precise mapping to the transcript need improvement.

**Improvement Strategy:**
- Directly address the risk of creating compound requirements—explicitly instruct the agent to break down broad or multi-part user needs into strictly atomic requirements.
- Urge conservative interpretation: instruct that a requirement statement should not restate or expand beyond what is explicitly stated or directly implied in the `source_quote`.
- Instruct to avoid assumption-based extrapolation (e.g., scalability), unless the implication is very direct and strong.
- Tighten guidance on traceability: make clear that the `statement` must be fully and precisely justified by the provided `source_quote` (both in specificity and scope), and discourage summary-style requirements.
- Add a guideline to check for overlap and duplication, ensuring requirements are distinct and not merged.
- Preserve the strict JSON output as before.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst with a strict focus on traceability and granularity. Your task is to extract all system requirements from the provided transcript and express them at the most atomic and traceable level.

**Task:**
Carefully analyze the complete interview transcript below. Identify and list each truly distinct (atomic) system requirement that the stakeholder expresses, whether functional or non-functional. For every requirement, you must include a direct, *verbatim* quote from the *stakeholder’s* speech as justification, and your requirement statement must be phrased so it is fully supported and bounded by that quote alone.

**Special Traceability and Atomicity Instructions:**
- *Source Quotes*: For each requirement, the `source_quote` must be only the stakeholder's own words—never include, paraphrase, or summarize content from the interviewer, interviewer questions, or combined interchanges. If the stakeholder's answer is merely ""Yes,"" use this as the quote only if the referent to the actual features is unambiguous from the immediately preceding interviewer question, and then only reference those features listed by the interviewer in the requirement, not in the `source_quote`.
- *Atomicity*: Whenever the stakeholder refers to several features or needs together (e.g., ""manage accounts taxes etc""), you must split this into separate, atomic requirements, each justified by the specific aspect mentioned in the stakeholder's quote. Use only the smallest, most relevant fragment of the stakeholder's statement as the `source_quote` for each.
- *Ambiguity*: If the stakeholder uses a phrase that is ambiguous or lacks detail (e.g., ""management applications""), your requirement should *reproduce* the ambiguous phrase verbatim in the statement, rather than infer a more detailed scope.
- *Verbatim Only*: Do not summarize the stakeholder’s meaning, do not paraphrase, and do not invent or infer supporting justification. If a requirement is referenced in the interviewer's question and the stakeholder responds only with ""Yes"" or ""Yes all of them,"" use only ""Yes"" or ""Yes all of them"" as the source quote.
- *No Interviewer Content*: Never use interviewer statements, summaries, or paraphrases as justification or quotes.

**Further Instructions:**
- Do not elicit more than 30 requirements. Focus on true, non-duplicative, atomic requirements.
- Do not combine multiple needs into a single requirement, always separate them.
- If a possible requirement is only referenced as requiring input from another party, or is not specified, do not elicit a requirement for it.
- If urgency or timeline is mentioned, also elicit this as a non-functional requirement.

**Output Format:**
Your answer must be *only* a single, valid JSON object (no extra explanation, commentary, or markdown fencing). Use this structure:

```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall allow a user to register for a new account using an email address and password."",
      ""source_quote"": ""So, obviously, a new user needs to be able to sign up, you know, just with their email.""
    }},
    {{
      ""id"": ""R2"",
      ""statement"": ""The system must load the main dashboard in under 2 seconds."",
      ""source_quote"": ""It's just got to be fast, I can't be waiting around for the main page to load.""
    }}
  ]
}}
```

Stakeholder: Hello
Interviewer: Hello! Thank you for joining me today. To get started, could you please tell me about your business and the project you are currently working on?
Stakeholder: Hello, we are running a chain of three ski resorts, that are mostly new and trying to increase our customer base. For this goal we are working on a new website which should also help us to streamline our business and help mange the resorts
Interviewer: That sounds like an exciting project! Could you tell me more about the specific goals you have for the new website? For example, how you envision it helping you increase your customer base and streamline operations across your resorts?
Stakeholder: The website should manage new reservations, hiring, the customers should be able to book training classes and in general be a tool to expose us to new customers
Interviewer: Great, it seems like the website will serve multiple purposes. Regarding reservations, how do you envision the booking process working for customers? Are there any specific features or integrations you want to include in this process, such as booking calendar synchronization, payment gateways, or customer profiles?

````";"**Step 1: Gap Analysis**

**A. Missing Requirements**
1. **""...help streamline our business and help manage the resorts""** - The agent did not explicitly write a requirement for the system to streamline business operations or manage resorts (besides reservations/hiring/etc), even though it's mentioned as a motivation.
2. **Management Applications** - ""management applications"" (with job listings) is ambiguous, but the agent assumed this referred to management of job applications. This is reasonable but could be made clearer.
3. **""We are also running out of time so we need to finish""** - Stakeholder is expressing urgency on completion/time to finish, this nuance is not captured as a non-functional urgency or 'time to market' type requirement, only the final deadline is captured.
4. **Supporting ""all resorts"" as a system constraint** - Requirements R12 and R13 reference centralized management for ""all resorts"", which is correct, but there's no explicit requirement for multi-resort support or visibility.
5. **'Streamlining' and 'help manage the resorts'** - The phrase ""help manage the resorts"" is in the first stakeholder response but is not directly captured as a distinct requirement beyond managing specific entities like reservations and hiring.
6. **""No specific third party service so we are open to suggestions""** – The openness to external service selection is not captured as a requirement or constraint, though this is arguably more of a project management note than a formal requirement.
7. **Training Class Booking** – R3 covers booking training classes for customers.

**B. Misinterpreted Requirements**
1. **""The system shall provide functionality to manage hiring.""** (R2) - The source quote is ""the website should manage new reservations, hiring,"" which is fine as a split. However, the compound source quote may cause confusion, atomic quoting is preferable.
2. **R5, R6, R7 (""Yes all of them"" as the source_quote)** – The source quote is an interviewer question listing several features, and the stakeholder simply says ""Yes all of them."" This could be problematic, the true source quote should be only the stakeholder's affirmation, but the linked feature names are from the interviewer's question. This could cause traceability issues.
3. **R11: ""management applications""** – See above, this is ambiguous in the transcript and would benefit from quoting exactly what stakeholder said.

**C. Compound or Merged Requirements**
- Generally, the agent did a good job of splitting “reservations and hiring” and “accounts, taxes, etc.” into atomic requirements.
- Some source quotes group more than one atomic item (e.g., R2 uses a quote including “new reservations, hiring”), so the link between quote and requirement could be clearer/cleaner—ideally, the quote should match only the text justifying the requirement.

**D. Poor Phrasing**
- Some requirements are too general or use awkward language. For example, ""The system shall provide functionality to manage hiring"" is adequate, but could be more specific based on the transcript.
- ""The system shall serve as a tool to expose the ski resort business to new customers"" (R4) is slightly awkward and could be ""The system shall help expose us to new customers"" for closer alignment.

**E. Traceability Errors**
- The agent at times uses the entire question/response pair as a source quote (e.g., R5-R7), rather than strictly the stakeholder's wording.
- R14 uses ""The database is exclusivly for internal use, ecxept for the calender with opening, thats needed for customers to book a visit."" —which has a typo from the transcript, but otherwise is handled decently.
- Final deadline (“about a year”) is captured as R20.

**Step 2: Improvement Strategy & Self-Correction**
- **Primary Failure:** The main failure is in traceability and atomicity: the requirements often pair large compound quotes with atomic requirements, leading to weaker traceability, and the interviewer's question content is sometimes used as quoting justification, which is improper. All requirements must tie to strictly stakeholder statements and only in their original wording.
- Some requirements, such as “management applications,” are ambiguous in the transcript, the prompt should instruct the agent to retain ambiguous stakeholder phrases verbatim when the meaning is unclear, and avoid interpretive leaps.
- The agent must use only the *stakeholder’s* words, not interviewer summaries or questions, as `source_quote`.
- The agent must be meticulous about atomicity: if multiple, clearly distinct features are mentioned in a single quote, split them and quote only the relevant phrase for each.

**New prompt instructions should:**
- Instruct the agent to use only the *stakeholder’s* utterances (never the interviewer’s) for source quotes.
- If the justification is simply “Yes” or “Yes all of them” in response to a question listing features, the agent should specify the minimal justification as ""Yes,"" but only if the text before clearly links the referent. When the response is ambiguous, the agent should include the minimal supporting context.
- If the meaning of a stakeholder phrase is ambiguous (e.g., “management applications”), the agent must reproduce it verbatim in the requirement instead of making an assumption.
- Correct the agent’s tendency to combine large compound quotes and instead select the most narrow, contextually precise phrase as the `source_quote`.
- Reiterate that only the stakeholder’s literal statements (not paraphrased, summarized, or implied phrases from interviewer or context) may be used for *both* the `source_quote` and the justification for a requirement.
- If the agent is confronted with a compound phrase (e.g., ""manage accounts taxes etc""), requirements should be split but the `source_quote` for each requirement must only use the relevant part of the stakeholder's statement.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to carefully analyze an interview transcript and extract all system requirements mentioned by the speaker.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, elicit all requirements (include both functional and non-functional requirements, you do not need to specify or categorize). Your primary goal is to capture the user's needs as accurately and completely as possible.

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The original source transcript.

**Constraint: Do not elicit more than 30 requirements.** Focus only on the most critical and distinct user needs mentioned in the transcript.

**Guidelines for High-Quality Requirements:**
To ensure the requirements you extract are clear and useful, please follow these best practices:
- **Clarity:** The requirement should have only one clear interpretation.
- **Atomicity:** Each requirement should describe a single, distinct need. Avoid combining multiple ideas into one statement.
- **Completeness:** The requirement statement should be a full sentence that expresses a complete thought.
- **Source-Based:** Every requirement you list must be directly supported by a statement or a strong implication from the transcript.

**Output Format:**
You MUST produce your output as a single, valid JSON object. The root key must be ""requirements"", which contains a list of individual requirement objects. Provide only the JSON and no other commentary.

Each requirement object in the list must have the following structure:
- `id`: A simple, unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
- `statement`: The requirement text, written as a clear, formal sentence (e.g., ""The system shall..."").
- `source_quote`: A direct, verbatim quote from the transcript that justifies the requirement, ensuring traceability. Give a literal quote, not a summary or paraphrase. Make sure the quotes are verbatim from the transcript.

**Example of the required JSON structure:**
```json

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to carefully analyze an interview transcript and extract all system requirements mentioned or strongly implied by the speaker—including both what is desired and what is explicitly NOT desired.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, elicit all requirements (both functional and non-functional). Your primary goal is to capture the user's needs as accurately and completely as possible—including clear indications of excluded features, targeted user groups (e.g., customers, owners/staff), support for multiple entities (such as multiple resorts), and any operational or transitional requirements (such as moving from manual to automated processes).

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The original source transcript.

**Crucial Instructions for Requirement Elicitation:**
- **Negative and Exclusion Requirements:** Explicitly include requirements for what the system should NOT do if the stakeholder has clearly declined or ruled out a feature or approach.
- **Implied Transition Requirements:** If the transcript mentions moving from an old/manual process to the new system, explicitly state requirements about replacing or supporting this transition.
- **Entity/Scope Support:** If the transcript strongly implies multiple locations, users, or distinct groups (e.g., three ski resorts), ensure requirements reflect this support.
- **Role-Specific Requirements:** Include requirements that affect different user roles (e.g., owners, administrators, staff) as well as customers.
- **Verbatim Source Quotes:** For every requirement, the `source_quote` must provide enough context to be unambiguous. If the speaker's answer is simply ""Yes,"" ""No,"" or similarly brief, include both the question and the answer (or the relevant exchange) as the `source_quote` for full traceability.
- **Separated and Clear Requirements:** Each requirement must be atomic, describing only one distinct need or system property.
- **Coverage of Intent and Prioritization:** If the transcript discusses priorities, reflect these priorities in requirements.
- **Do not infer features not directly supported by the transcript. Only extract what was stated, implied, or explicitly negated.**

**Constraint: Do not elicit more than 30 requirements.** Focus only on the most critical and distinct user needs mentioned or implied in the transcript.

**Guidelines for High-Quality Requirements:**
To ensure the requirements you extract are clear and useful, you must:
- **Clarity:** The requirement should have only one clear interpretation.
- **Atomicity:** Each requirement should describe a single, distinct need. Avoid combining multiple ideas into one statement.
- **Completeness:** The requirement statement should be a full sentence that expresses a complete thought.
- **Negative Requirements:** If the stakeholder explicitly rejects a feature, include a requirement stating that the system shall NOT include that feature.
- **Source-Based:** Every requirement must be directly supported by a verbatim quote from the transcript. For brief stakeholder answers, include both the interviewer's question and the stakeholder’s concise reply as context.

**Output Format:**
You MUST produce your output as a single, valid JSON object. The root key must be ""requirements"", which contains a list of individual requirement objects. Provide **only** the JSON and no other commentary.

Each requirement object in the list must have the following structure:
- `id`: A simple, unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
- `statement`: The requirement text, written as a clear, formal sentence (e.g., ""The system shall..."" or ""The system shall NOT..."").
- `source_quote`: A direct, verbatim quote (or contiguous transcript snippet) from the transcript that justifies the requirement, ensuring traceability. For minimal replies, include both the relevant question and the user's answer.

**Example of the required JSON structure:**
```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall allow a user to register for a new account using an email address and password."",
      ""source_quote"": ""So, obviously, a new user needs to be able to sign up, you know, just with their email.""
    }},
    {{
      ""id"": ""R2"",
      ""statement"": ""The system must load the main dashboard in under 2 seconds."",
      ""source_quote"": ""It's just got to be fast, I can't be waiting around for the main page to load.""
    }},
    {{
      ""id"": ""R3"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall NOT include a customer review or feedback feature."",
      ""source_quote"": ""Based on these requirements, do you think including a feature for customer feedback or reviews would be beneficial for your website?\nStakeholder: No it is mainly Abort advertising""
    }}
  ]
}}
```

**Your output must be only the JSON object as described, and nothing else.**
```";"**Step 1: Gap Analysis**
1. **Missing Requirements:**
   - **Manual Process Transition:** Stakeholder repeatedly mentions managing everything manually (""I do everything manually"") and having to receive reservations by phone and fax, with semi-manual, in-person payments. A requirement should specifically state that the system is to replace the manual process, not just add new features.
   - **Multi-Resort Support:** Stakeholder owns three ski resorts (""I own 3 Resorts for skiing""), but no requirement explicitly states that the system must support multi-resort operation or distinguish between the resorts.
   - **Advertising Focus:** The answer ""No it is mainly Abort advertising"" (likely typo for ""about advertising"") is interpreted as purpose, but could be sharpened. The stakeholder declines customer feedback/reviews and states the main purpose is advertising, so a requirement should clarify there is **no customer review or feedback feature**.
   - **Stakeholder Role:** The system must support owner/staff/admin interactions (e.g., inventory management ""for the owner""), but this is only implied, not explicit.
   - **No Additional Payment Methods:** When asked if there are other methods or preferences for payment handling (""No""), there should be an explicit requirement limiting payment methods to what was confirmed.
   - **Stakeholders:** The transcript includes two prompts about whether other stakeholders' needs should be considered. The stakeholder says, ""That's it."" A requirement could be added confirming only the primary stakeholder's needs should be considered at this phase.

2. **Misinterpreted Requirements:**
   - **R12:** The source_quote for supported payment methods (""Yes"") is too vague, it does not by itself justify a formal requirement about credit cards and PayPal. The agent infers based on the interviewer, not on explicit stakeholder confirmation, potentially overstating support for ""other methods.""
   - **R6:** ""No it is mainly Abort advertising"" becomes ""used primarily for advertising,"" but doesn't explicitly rule out reviews/feedback or clarify that bookings are a core function as well—a nuance that’s not made explicit. This could be more clearly stated.
   - **R7:** ""The reservation and payment systems shall be the highest priority features of the website"" from ""The reservation and the payment system"" is an interpretation that puts them as highest priority—though ""most important"" was asked, the stakeholder merely listed them, not their explicit ranking. The requirement could be more neutral.

3. **Compound Requirements:**
   - **R20:** ""Integration with the booking system to automatically adjust available equipment after reservations"" should perhaps be split into two: (a) automatic adjustment of inventory and (b) real-time availability updates, even if both were confirmed together with a single ""Yes.""
   - **R8:** ""manage reservations and payments"" could be written as two separate requirements for clarity (though arguably not wrong as is).

4. **Poor Phrasing/Vagueness:**
   - **R5/R15:** ""integration with major social media platforms for sharing and connectivity"" and ""enable general sharing and connectivity for promotions"" both say similar things. The former is poorly specific, the latter could instead clearly differentiate between sharing promotions and general connectivity.
   - **R13/R14:** Both requirements draw on the same source_quote but cover two related transitions (online payments and moving away from manual/fax). They should be more explicitly separated.
   - **Use of 'shall':** Requirements use ""shall,"" which is good, but sometimes the restatement is longer than needed, leading to subtle ambiguity in intent.

5. **Traceability Errors:**
   - Some `source_quote` fields are just ""Yes"" or ""No,"" which fail to provide direct, meaningful traceability for substantial requirements (e.g., R12, R15).
   - `source_quote` should capture the surrounding context (full Q/A or at least the pertinent contiguous lines) for ambiguous one-word stakeholder replies.
   - R12 infers payment methods from interviewer's question, not directly from the stakeholder's ""Yes.""

**Step 2: Improvement Strategy & Self-Correction**
- The main failure was **inadequate handling of contextually implicit and negated requirements**, especially where requirements were implied by the context (e.g., multi-resort, transition from manual), explicitly negated (declined reviews/feedback), or not directly confirmed (payment methods, who the stakeholders are, etc.).
- The previous prompt did not force the agent to:
    - Explicitly extract requirements about the transition from the old (manual) to new (online) system.
    - Capture negative requirements (features to be excluded or limitations confirmed in the transcript).
    - Consider requirements that apply specifically to staff/owners versus customer-facing functions.
    - Accurately attach traceable, verbatim `source_quote` when responses are minimal.
    - Avoid ambiguity from yes/no answers by including the surrounding Q/A in quotes when needed.
- The prompt should now include:
    - A strong directive to include negative requirements (features the user explicitly does not want).
    - An instruction to infer and explicitly state transition/legacy requirements (e.g., from manual to automated systems).
    - Explicit guidance on multi-site or multi-entity support if strongly implied.
    - A clear instruction that traceability requires inclusion of enough conversational context for yes/no answers—a minimal answer is insufficient on its own.
    - Clarify that requirements for system administrators/owners (not just customers) should be extracted.
    - A reminder to check for both inclusion and deliberate exclusion of requirements.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to thoroughly analyze the provided interview transcript and extract all system requirements explicitly mentioned or strongly implied by the stakeholder—including both what is desired and what is explicitly NOT desired.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, elicit all system requirements (functional and non-functional) in a way that is detailed, precise, and actionable. Your primary goal is to capture the user's needs with maximum accuracy and traceability—including explicit exclusions, targeted user groups (e.g., customers and/or owners/staff), support for multiple entities (such as multiple resorts), and relevant operational or transitional requirements (such as process changes from manual to automated).

**Transcript Context Provided:**
1. `{interview_transcript}`: The unabridged source transcript is provided below.

**Crucial Instructions for Requirement Elicitation:**

- **Atomicity:** Each requirement must describe only one distinct user need or system property. **If a statement or user intent involves more than one distinct need (e.g., both bookings and payments), split it into multiple atomic requirements.** Avoid compounding multiple features or roles in a single requirement.
- **No Duplicates:** Carefully review your extracted requirements and eliminate duplicates or near-duplicates. Where two requirements overlap, keep the most precise, clearly supported, and actionable version.
- **Verbatim Source Quotes:** For every requirement, the `source_quote` must be a verbatim snippet from the transcript that is fully sufficient to justify the requirement. If the user reply is short, such as ""Yes,"" ""No,"" or similarly brief, **always include both the interviewer's question and the user's reply together as the `source_quote` for full context and traceability.**
- **Negative and Exclusion Requirements:** Explicitly include requirements for what the system should NOT do if the transcript contains rejection or exclusion of a feature. Use negative phrasing: e.g., ""The system shall NOT..."".
- **Implied Transition Requirements:** If the transcript discusses moving from a manual or outdated process to a new system, explicitly state requirements about replacing, automating, or improving that process.
- **Entity/Scope Requirements:** If the transcript clearly indicates multiple business entities, locations, user roles, or distinct user groups (e.g., three separate resorts), **explicitly include a requirement reflecting this need**.
- **Role-Specific Requirements:** If the transcript differentiates needs for different user types (e.g., customers, admin/staff/owners), create role-specific requirements where appropriate.
- **Prioritization Only if System-Affecting:** If the stakeholder talks about feature priorities, only include priority requirements if they have implications for system operation, user flow, or interface (not merely statements of stakeholder preference for planning).
- **No Unsupported Inference:** Do not invent or extrapolate requirements beyond what is directly stated, unambiguously implied, or clearly negated in the transcript.
- **No Redundant or Vague Requirements:** Omit requirements that are merely restatements, have no concrete impact on the system, or are unsupported by the transcript.
- **Clarity and Completeness:** Each requirement must be a complete, unambiguous sentence starting with ""The system shall..."" or ""The system shall NOT..."", written in formal requirements language.

**Special Instructions and Examples:**
- **ADMIN INTERFACE:** Only specify features for owners/staff/admin interfaces if the transcript clearly mentions them. Do not infer administrative features from mentions of ""database"" alone unless tasks or features are specified.
- **CENTRALIZED DATABASE:** If requested, split this into atomic requirements about what data or entities are to be centralized (e.g., reservations, payments)—**do not combine database needs with UI/admin features.**
- **SOCIAL MEDIA INTEGRATION:** Focus on the explicit goals given for ""social media connection"" (such as ""acquire a larger set of customers"") and state the need accordingly.
- **PAYMENT METHODS:** If the transcript lists payment methods only as examples confirmed by ""Yes,"" extract atomic requirements only for those methods explicitly covered or affirmed.
- **SOURCE QUOTES:** Always ensure the `source_quote` for each requirement provides proper context, especially for brief or unclear exchanges.

**Constraint:**  
Do NOT produce more than 30 requirements. Extract only the most critical, distinct needs mentioned or directly implied by the transcript.

**Output Format:**  
Produce your output as a single, valid JSON object. The root key must be ""requirements"", which contains a list of objects—one per atomic requirement.

Each requirement object in the list must have the following structure:
- `id`: A unique ID string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"", ...).
- `statement`: A clear, formal requirement sentence as described above.
- `source_quote`: A verbatim quote (or combined interviewer question and stakeholder reply) from the transcript justifying the requirement.

**Example Output:**
```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall allow customers to book rooms online."",
      ""source_quote"": ""Stakeholder: I want a Website wäre customers can Book rooms, Equipment, Ski Training classes""

      ""source_quote"": ""Interviewer: Based on these requirements, do you think including a feature for customer feedback or reviews would be beneficial for your website?\nStakeholder: No it is mainly Abort advertising""
    }}
  ]

**Your output must be only the JSON object as described, and nothing else.**

**BEGIN ANALYSIS OF THE FOLLOWING TRANSCRIPT:**

{interview_transcript}
````";"**1. Missing Requirements**
- **Explicit Support for Owner/Staff Administrative Operations:** While R28 does mention a centralized administration interface, the transcript does not specify administrative UI requirements, only that the stakeholder wants a centralized database. The administrative needs for owners and staff (distinct from ""customers"") were not discussed in detail in the transcript and therefore should not have been inferred unless directly mentioned.
- **Online Account Creation/Login:** The requirements list does not cover if user accounts or authentication are required for bookings/payments, nor does the transcript discuss this. However, the transcript does not support inferring such needs, so this absence is correct per instruction.
- **Multi-location Data Segregation:** While R16 says the system supports three resorts, it is unclear if bookings/inventory are per-resort, or pooled, this was not clarified in the interview and cannot be inferred further.
- **Performance, Reliability, and Security:** The transcript does not mention or imply non-functional requirements like system performance (speed), uptime, or security precautions. The omission is appropriate since the transcript does not cover these points.
- **Accessibility/Language:** Not mentioned by user, so omission is appropriate.
- **No requirement about requiring user registration for bookings or purchases.** The transcript does not mention needing to register, so this is correctly omitted.

**2. Misinterpreted Requirements**
- R22 (""The website shall support advertising and promotional functions through social media connections."") interprets ""No it is mainly Abort advertising"" as supporting advertising, however, the stakeholder uses ""Abort"" here possibly as a mistranslation for ""about"" (meaning ""for""), or may simply mean the social connection's only purpose is advertising. The requirement as stated could be misleading. A clearer statement would be: ""The system shall provide social media sharing features for the purpose of advertising and acquiring new customers,"" directly reflecting the stakeholder's stated intent of ""acquire a larger set of customers.""
- Requirements R12 and R26 both refer to enabling online payments, seemingly duplicating the same requirement.
- R10 and R27 are almost duplicates (""as intuitive as possible"" vs. ""intuitive user interface for all customer-facing processes, especially reservations and payments""), and both cite the same justification.

**3. Compound Requirements**
- R28 combines managing bookings, payments, and inventory for all three resorts into one requirement, which should be atomized according to the instructions.
- R15 encompasses adding other payment methods generically if needed, but is based only on ""yes"" in answer to ""such as credit card, PayPal, or others?"" The requirement should be made clearer or possibly omitted, as ""Yes"" is only full consent to examples, not a specification for open-ended payment expansion.

**4. Poor Phrasing**
- R8 (""The system shall prioritize reservation and payment system features above other system features."") is awkward as a requirement for an engineering specification unless system behavior changes based on priority. This is more of a design/planning note than a system requirement unless priority visually affects workflow or UI.
- Some requirements are stated in a passive or imprecise form, e.g., ""The system shall serve customers as its primary user group"" (R21), which is not actionable and redundant given context.

**5. Traceability Errors**
- Some `source_quote`s do not sufficiently capture the context. For example, in requirements where the stakeholder's answer is ""Yes"" or ""No"", the adjacent question is often not fully quoted, making it less traceable. Proper traceability requires both question and answer for all brief replies.
- R15's ""source_quote"" does not sufficiently justify the idea of ""other common online payment methods if needed"" based on what was in the transcript.

**Primary failure:**  
The main failure was improper **atomicity**—multiple requirements in the list improperly combine distinct needs (compound requirements), while others are nearly duplicated or vague (poor atomicity/clarity). Additionally, the prompt did not emphasize the importance of splitting requirements fully or of careful quote selection, leading to traceability and clarity issues.

**Improvement Strategy:**  
- Explicitly instruct the agent to avoid compound requirements by atomizing multifunctional needs (e.g., ""If a single statement involves more than one distinct user need, split it into multiple requirements."").
- Clearly instruct to avoid duplicated or overlapping requirements, when there is redundancy, the most precise/correct version should be preferred.
- Provide clearer instructions and examples for quoting both interviewer questions AND stakeholder answers for all brief or ambiguous responses for full traceability.
- State that vague requirements such as ""prioritization"" or ""primary user group"" should only be included as actionable requirements if they directly impact system behavior, otherwise omit them.
- Instruct to carefully choose atomic requirement boundaries, especially when interpreting ""centralized database,"" ""administrative interface,"" and payment options.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to carefully analyze an interview transcript and elicit every explicit and strongly implied system requirement mentioned by the speaker.

**Your Tasks:**
1. Extract all requirements (both functional and non-functional) that are either directly stated or clearly implied in the transcript, especially from business context statements (e.g., the current process is manual, no computer in use).
2. In addition to explicit requirements, actively identify and extract user needs relating to:
   - Usability (ease of use, especially for users transitioning from manual to digital workflows),
   - Initial data migration or support for non-technical users (where such needs are implied in context),
   - User roles, permissions, or administrative capabilities (where implied by references to staff or employees),
   - Security, privacy, or data protection considerations (e.g., where business records or client data are mentioned),
   - Any other critical business constraints or non-functional requirements (NFRs) important to successful system use.

**De-duplication and Clarity Requirements:**
- Do not include requirements that are merely paraphrased duplicates, restatements, or lower/higher-level breakdowns of other requirements.
- Ensure every requirement is atomic, clear, and non-redundant.
- Prefer the more detailed/granular requirement when the transcript provides multiple levels of detail for the same feature.

**Source Quote Fidelity:**
- For every requirement, you must provide a verbatim “source_quote”: a literal cut-and-paste excerpt from the transcript that directly supports or implies the requirement.
- Do not include paraphrased, summarized, or invented text as the source quote under any circumstances.
- If the requirement is drawn from a scenario or implied context, use the exact relevant excerpt from the transcript.

**Output Format (mandatory):**

Stakeholder: Hello  
Interviewer: Hello! I'm GPTREI, your requirements elicitation assistant. Today, I will be gathering detailed information about your project needs to ensure we understand all requirements clearly. Before we begin, are you in line with the scope of this interview or do your expectations differ?  
Stakeholder: I'm in line  
Interviewer: Great to hear that! To start off, could you please introduce yourself and your connection to this project?  
Stakeholder: Hey I'm Nancy, I'm the owner of the hair dressing shop  
Interviewer: Thank you for the introduction, Nancy. How would you describe your project in two to four sentences?  
Stakeholder: I would like a system for my Salon which offers a booking system for clients to make appointments, keeps track of my business records, keeps track of supplies and notifies me when supplies are running out and should be ordered and  provides data in form of reports to run the business more efficiently  
Interviewer: Thank you for the description, Nancy. Let's talk a bit about the systems and workflows you currently use. Can you describe the current process or system you use for appointment bookings, business records, and inventory management?  
Stakeholder: At present the business is running manually, there is no computer. A reservation diary is used to record customer appointments.  
Interviewer: Got it, thank you for explaining. Let's move on to the project features. What current processes do you want to change or improve, and what features do you hope to get from this new salon system?  
Stakeholder: As I said I would like a system for my Salon which offers a booking system for clients to make appointments, keeps track of my business records, keeps track of supplies and notifies me when supplies are running out and should be ordered and provides data in form of reports to run the business more efficiently  
Interviewer: Thank you for clarifying. To confirm, the features/functions you're looking for in this salon system are: a booking system for appointments, a business records management system, inventory tracking with supply notifications, and a reporting system for business data. Is that correct? Are there any other features you would like to add?  
Stakeholder: No that's exactly what I need!  
Interviewer: Great, thank you for confirming. Let's move on to prioritizing these features. Which of these features are most critical for your salon, and which ones could be considered secondary in terms of priority?  
Stakeholder: The booking system is the most important  
Interviewer: Thank you for identifying your top priority. Let's gather more detailed requirements for the booking system. Could you elaborate on what you'd like the booking system to accomplish for your salon?  
Stakeholder: Due to the large number of employees, the scheduling and allocation of staff has become a significant issue that I hope will be improved with the new system. Also I want to offer a convenient solution for costumers to book appointments.  
Interviewer: Thank you for detailing that. It seems like the booking system should help with scheduling and allocating staff efficiently, as well as providing an easy way for customers to book appointments. Could you describe how you'd imagine customers interacting with this booking system? Would it be through an app, a website, or another method?  
Interviewer: You're welcome, Nancy! I'm glad to hear that it aligns with your vision. Thank you for your time, and feel free to reach out if you have any more questions or need further assistance in the future. Looking forward to our next session. Have a great day!  
Stakeholder: An app and a website would be the best  
Interviewer: Great choice. How do you envision the appointment booking process through the app and website? Could you please walk me through how a customer would make a booking starting from the initial page?  
Stakeholder: I'm not really sure, could you help me with that?  
Interviewer: Of course, Nancy! Here's a scenario to consider:  

1. **Home Page**: When a customer visits the app or website, they see the home page that offers an option to ""Book an Appointment.""  
   
2. **Service Selection**: Upon clicking, they are directed to a page listing all available services. They can select one or more services they are interested in.

3. **Employee and Time Selection**: Next, the customer sees available staff members and time slots based on the selected services. They choose a preferred hairstylist and time slot.

4. **Customer Details**: After selecting a time, the customer enters their personal details if they are a new client or logs in if they are returning.

5. **Confirmation**: The customer then receives a confirmation message summarizing their booking.

Does this flow align with what you have in mind, or is there anything you'd like to change or add?  
Stakeholder: Thats perfect. Thank you very much and see you next time
```";"**Gap Analysis**

1. **Missing Requirements:**
   - **System Environment / Platform:** The transcript directly states “At present the business is running manually, there is no computer.” While this is context rather than a requirement, it strongly implies that the system must be usable by a business making a transition from entirely manual/non-digital workflows. However, this isn't captured as a requirement (e.g., ease of use for non-technical users, initial digitization support, data migration, or even support for a greenfield setup).
   - **Data Entry/Data Migration Capabilities:** The migration from a reservation diary to a new system is implicitly required but not stated.
   - **User Roles / Permissions:** There is no mention in the output of administrative functions, owner vs staff access, etc., despite the owner being a primary user and mention of ""large number of employees.""
   - **Security/Privacy:** Nowhere is there a requirement regarding securing customer data or confidential business records.
   - **Reliability/Availability:** No system uptime or error recovery mentions, but in the context (business-critical, appointment diary replacement), some NFRs could be implied.
   - **Usability/Accessibility:** Nancy's unfamiliarity with software implies ease-of-use is a requirement that isn't recorded.

2. **Misinterpreted or Redundant Requirements:**
   - Several requirements are redundant or split in an odd way. For example:
     - R3 (“keep track of supplies”) and R18 (“include inventory tracking to monitor supplies used in salon operations”) are almost identical.
     - R4/R19 for supply notifications are likewise duplicative.
     - R5/R20 about reports are paraphrases of the same point.
   - Some requirements are restated at a higher or lower level of detail (e.g., R1, R6, R7, R8, R17).

3. **Compound Requirements:**
   - Most requirements are properly atomic. However, some requirements are so high level (e.g., ""The system shall provide a booking system for clients to make appointments"") that they are functionally compound or at best placeholders for more granular functions described later.

4. **Poor Phrasing:**
   - Requirements such as R17 (“The booking system shall offer a convenient solution for customers to book appointments”) are ambiguous (“convenient” is subjective and isn't operationally defined).
   - Some requirements are simply restatements of the transcript without rephrasing for clarity or normalization to standard SRS format.

5. **Traceability Errors:**
   - **Source Quotes:** Several “source_quote” are not fully verbatim (e.g., R6 and R7 use “An app and a website would be the best” as justification for “The system shall allow customers to book appointments through an app/website,” but the quote itself does not specify booking by these means in those words).
   - Sometimes the quote provided is not a literal excerpt but a paraphrase, violating the instruction.

**Primary Failure:**
- The main failure is **incomplete and insufficiently precise requirement extraction due to lack of explicit attention to:**
  - Minor but critical implied requirements (usability, initial transition/ease of use, data migration)
  - Avoidance of redundancy or overlapping requirements.
  - Strict enforcement that each “source_quote” is copy-pasted verbatim.
  - Distinguishing between paraphrase and actual transcript quote.
  - Inclusion of any non-functional requirements that are implied (such as “convenience,” “efficiency,” or “ease of transition”).
  - Addressing implied constraints from business context (e.g., lack of computers, manual transition).

**Improvement Strategy:**
- Add specific instructions to **capture all implied as well as explicit requirements**, especially those about usability, user roles, transition from manual systems, and security/privacy.
- Enforce **elimination of redundancies**—do not include restatements or merely paraphrased duplications.
- Require that every “source_quote” be a **literal, verbatim, cut-and-paste** excerpt from the transcript—that is, the tool must not invent or paraphrase text or fudge on this point, even if it makes requirements harder to extract.
- Instruct the agent to **reflect on the context** (e.g., the business is coming from a manual/non-digital process) for implied requirements such as usability or data migration, if supported in the transcript.
- Encourage the agent to **capture non-functional requirements and business context-derived needs,** where they are directly supported or strongly implied by the transcript.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst with advanced skills in requirements elicitation, especially for systems transitioning from manual to digital workflows and serving non-technical users. Your core task is to analyze the provided interview transcript and elicit ALL critical system requirements, with a special focus on those needs that are strongly implied rather than plainly stated.

**Your Tasks:**

1. Carefully extract EVERY requirement (functional and non-functional) that is directly stated OR strongly implied in the transcript. Do not filter out requirements merely because they are not stated verbatim, if the business context, workflow, stakeholder role, or process implies a need, include it.
   
2. In addition to explicit requirements, pay particular attention to and extract needs regarding:
   - **Transition and Migration:** Identify any need or implication for migrating existing (manual/paper-based) business records to the new system or supporting first-time users who lack computer experience.
   - **Usability and Onboarding:** Extract requirements that serve non-technical users or those moving from manual systems, such as initial onboarding steps, tutorials, help, guidance, or simplified interfaces.
   - **User Roles, Permissions, and Administration:** Pay close attention to context around staff, employees, scheduling, or owner tasks, infer and specify requirements for user accounts, staff roles, administrative controls, or differentiated access if implied.
   - **Security, Privacy, and Data Protection:** Where the transcript references business records, client details, or employee information, explicitly extract requirements related to data privacy, protection, access control, and secure handling (even if only implied).
   - **Other Critical Business Constraints or Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs):** For performance, reliability, accessibility, compliance, audit, and similar, extract requirements if any part of the transcript or context suggests a need.

3. **Atomicity and De-duplication:**
   - Each requirement must be *atomic*—address a single, distinct need. Do not combine unrelated needs in one statement.
   - Where overlapping or hierarchical requirements exist, prefer the most granular, detailed statement that the transcript supports.
   - Remove all redundancy—avoid duplicate requirements, or those that are simple paraphrases of others.

4. **Source Quote Fidelity:**
   - For every requirement, supply a verbatim “source_quote”: literal cut-and-paste text from the transcript that justifies or supports the requirement. You may select any indicative context, statement, or scenario, but you MUST NOT paraphrase, summarize, invent, or alter the quote.
   - If the requirement is drawn from an implied need, use the exact supporting context (sentence or passage) from the transcript to justify it.

5. **Output Format (mandatory):**
   Your output MUST be a single, valid JSON object with the root key `""requirements""`, containing a list of requirements.
   - Each requirement object MUST have:
     - `id`: A unique string identifier (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"", ...).
     - `statement`: The requirement in a full formal sentence (e.g., “The system shall ...”).
     - `source_quote`: The verbatim excerpt from the transcript justifying/supporting the requirement.
   - Produce *only* the JSON output. Absolutely no commentary, explanations, or introductory text.

6. **Input Context:**
   1. `{interview_transcript}` — The transcript provided below.

```";"**Primary Failure:**  
The main failure of the previous agent was the omission of several strongly implied non-functional and transition-focused requirements, especially those pertaining to initial data migration and support for non-technical users. Although the prompt explicitly instructed to elicit needs related to usability, data migration, user roles, security, and non-functional constraints, the requirements output did NOT include:
- *Data migration*: There is a clear indication that current records are paper-based (""At present the business is running manually, there is no computer. A reservation diary is used to record customer appointments""), but no requirement about importing, digitizing, or facilitating the transition of existing records is stated.
- *Usability for non-technical users*: The transcript (manual, paper diary) strongly implies the need for user-friendly onboarding, but there’s only a generic suitability statement (""The system shall be suitable for users transitioning from manual to digital workflows"") rather than an actionable usability or onboarding requirement.
- *Training/Help*: No mention of training aids, in-app help, or onboarding processes.
- *Security/privacy*: While business records, customer details, and staff scheduling are core, there is no requirement about logging, privacy, protecting user/client data, or data access restrictions.
- *User roles/permissions/administration*: With ""large number of employees,"" it is implied there may be a need for user accounts, differentiated access, staff and admin roles, but nothing is drawn out in the requirements.
- *Compound requirements*: Some requirements combine multiple needs (e.g., R3 – supply tracking AND notifications) when these might warrant separation for clarity and atomicity.
- *Traceability/Wording Issues*: Some statements paraphrase or summarize rather than quote exactly from the transcript (e.g., R14's ""suitable for users transitioning..."" is not found verbatim, and its justification is weak).

**Self-correction Strategy:**
- Explicitly instruct that requirements about transition from manual records (data migration/import), usability for non-technical and first-time users (onboarding, help), privacy/security (especially given business records and personal details), and user roles/permissions (since staff are referenced in context and features) must be *extracted if even strongly implied.*
- Require that all requirements are *atomic*: separating distinct functional or non-functional needs into their own requirement statements.
- Demand absolute fidelity for source quotes: only literal verbatim transcript text, no paraphrasing, no invention. If supporting the requirement requires quoting and linking to a specific scenario or context sentence, include it fully.
- Guide the agent to prioritize detection of transition requirements and user role/security needs, not just surface explicit features.";The system shall provide a booking system that allows clients to make appointments online.;I would like a system for my Salon which offers a booking system for clients to make appointments;The system shall allow customers to book appointments via both a website and an app.;An app and a website would be the best;The system shall maintain business records relevant to salon operations.;keeps track of my business records;The system shall track inventory levels of salon supplies.;keeps track of supplies;The system shall notify the owner when supplies are running low and should be reordered.;notifies me when supplies are running out and should be ordered;The system shall generate business data reports to support efficient salon management.;provides data in form of reports to run the business more efficiently;The system shall improve the scheduling and allocation of staff for appointments.;Due to the large number of employees, the scheduling and allocation of staff has become a significant issue that I hope will be improved with the new system.;The system shall provide a convenient booking mechanism for customers.;Also I want to offer a convenient solution for costumers to book appointments.;The system shall support migration or onboarding of existing manual (diary-based) appointment records into the digital system.;At present the business is running manually, there is no computer.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to carefully analyze an interview transcript and extract all system requirements mentioned by the speaker.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, elicit all requirements (include both functional and non-functional requirements, you do not need to specify or categorize). Your primary goal is to capture the user's needs as accurately and completely as possible.

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The original source transcript.

**Constraint: Do not elicit more than 30 requirements.** Focus only on the most critical and distinct user needs mentioned in the transcript.

**Guidelines for High-Quality Requirements:**
To ensure the requirements you extract are clear and useful, please follow these best practices:
- **Clarity:** The requirement should have only one clear interpretation.
- **Atomicity:** Each requirement should describe a single, distinct need. Avoid combining multiple ideas into one statement.
- **Completeness:** The requirement statement should be a full sentence that expresses a complete thought.
- **Source-Based:** Every requirement you list must be directly supported by a statement or a strong implication from the transcript.

**Output Format:**
You MUST produce your output as a single, valid JSON object. The root key must be ""requirements"", which contains a list of individual requirement objects. Provide only the JSON and no other commentary.

Each requirement object in the list must have the following structure:
- `id`: A simple, unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
- `statement`: The requirement text, written as a clear, formal sentence (e.g., ""The system shall..."").
- `source_quote`: A direct, verbatim quote from the transcript that justifies the requirement, ensuring traceability. Give a literal quote, not a summary or paraphrase. Make sure the quotes are verbatim from the transcript.

**Example of the required JSON structure:**
```json

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to analyze an interview transcript and extract all explicit and strongly implied system requirements, both functional and non-functional.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, carefully elicit all requirements—functional and non-functional—including key qualities such as usability, performance, reliability, and accessibility, even if they are only strongly implied but not explicitly stated. Your main objective is to capture every distinct, atomic user need or expectation as accurately and completely as possible, and to ensure each requirement is directly traceable to a verbatim statement from the transcript.

**Critical Extraction Requirements:**
- **Atomicity:** Each requirement must reflect a single, distinct user need or feature. If one transcript sentence lists several needs, split them into separate requirement entries.
- **Verbatim Traceability:** For every requirement, the `source_quote` must be a direct, contiguous, and literal excerpt from the transcript, with no paraphrasing, combining, or ellipses.
- **Faithful Modality:** If the transcript says “should,” “could,” “would like to,” or “optionally,” your requirement statement must mirror this, unless the stakeholder explicitly prioritizes or confirms it as essential. For derived requirements (strongly implied but not stated), use prudent judgment and be ready to justify inclusion based on clear user expectations or standard system properties.
- **Explicit Non-functional Requirements:** You must identify and include non-functional requirements, especially about usability (“user-friendly,” simplicity), performance (“real time”), security, accessibility (“accessible on both desktop and mobile devices,” “easy to use”), and reliability if explicitly mentioned or clearly implied.
- **One-to-One Source-Statement Link:** Do not use summary or interpretation as the `source_quote`. Use only direct, literal lines or contiguous blocks from the transcript that justify the requirement.
- **No Compound Statements:** If a transcript excerpt implies multiple features (e.g., “confirmation and reminders,” “pay in person or online”), each should become its own requirement and only reference the relevant portion in its `source_quote`.
- **Explicitly Address Optionality:** If the user says they would “like,” “could,” or “optionally” want something, phrase the requirement as “The system should/may...” and not “shall/must,” unless later clarified as mandatory.

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The original source transcript.

**Constraints:**
- List no more than 30 requirements.
- Focus on the most critical and distinct user needs as expressed in the transcript.
- Your output must be a valid JSON object, with the root key ""requirements"" containing an array of requirement objects.

**Format Specification:**
Each requirement object must contain:
- `id`: A unique identifier, e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"", ..., ""R30"".
- `statement`: A clear, formal, and atomic requirement sentence, using prudent modality (“shall”, “should”, “may”, etc.) as justified by the transcript.
- `source_quote`: A direct, literal, and contiguous quote from the transcript that supports the requirement (no paraphrasing, fragment-joining, or ellipses).

**Example Output:**
```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall allow new users to register for an account using an email address and password."",
      ""source_quote"": ""So, obviously, a new user needs to be able to sign up, you know, just with their email.""
    }},
    {{
      ""id"": ""R2"",
      ""statement"": ""The system should load the main dashboard within two seconds."",
      ""source_quote"": ""It's just got to be fast, I can't be waiting around for the main page to load.""
    }}
  ]
}}
```

**Instructions:**
1. Read the transcript thoroughly.
2. Extract every requirement that is explicitly stated or strongly implied.
3. If a complex user goal spans several sentences but concerns a single function or quality, use the smallest contiguous block of transcript that directly supports your requirement statement.
4. Do not combine multiple needs into one requirement—even if they occur in a single transcript sentence or paragraph.
5. For every requirement you list, include the exact words from the transcript that justify it as the `source_quote`.
6. If you include an implied (non-explicit) requirement due to a clear standard or user expectation (e.g., basic accessibility, error prevention), be prepared to justify your extraction using the closest relevant transcript quote.

**Output:**
Return only your extracted requirements, in the specified JSON format. Do not include any commentary, explanation, or extra content.
```";"**1. Gap Analysis Findings**

**A. Missing Requirements**
- **Non-functional requirements**: Nowhere in the requirements JSON is there any mention of usability, performance (e.g., speed, availability), reliability, or system accessibility requirements—even though terms like “user-friendly” and “real time” are used repeatedly in the transcript.
- **Explicit notifications to clients and staff for schedule changes:** The source transcript repeatedly mentions that the system must notify both the client and staff of cancellations/reschedules or changes (""The system should notify both the client and staff of any changes to the booking""), but this is only partially reflected, and sometimes only for one party.
- **Separate concerns about scheduling rules and policies:** The transcript mentions compliance with labor regulations/company policy for breaks, but requirements do not clarify the need for the system to reference/allow configuration of such rules.
- **Staff preference handling:** The transcript details staff being able to set appointment-type preferences or blockout periods, but there is no requirement about staff being able to define such preferences in the agent’s output.
- **Cross-service coordination and buffer times:** The transcript notes the system should be able to coordinate sequential and parallel services, including time to switch or overlap (e.g., ""setting buffer times between services or allowing...overlapping""), which is missing.
- **Manual process replacement & migration:** The transcript discusses manual logs and record-keeping for bookings, staff, takings, and supplies. There is no requirement about possibly migrating or importing historical/manual data (strongly implied by ""I can reduce the work my accountant does by preparing digital records"").
- **System accessibility:** There is mention of ""accessible on both desktop and mobile devices,"" but the requirement does not clarify accessibility standards (e.g., accommodating for the ""user-friendly"" requirement or WCAG-compliance, which ""user-friendly"" could imply).
- **Limits/controls to admin overrides:** The text says, “The system should allow for overrides if I need to make exceptions to staff availability, such as adding a last-minute booking or changing who is assigned to an appointment."" The agent output merges this into a compound requirement with general schedule flexibility, but doesn’t specify audit/logging or controls for overrides—which, while only implied, is an important nuance.
- **Error handling/user guidance:** The transcript uses phrases like “help improve service quality,” “reduce errors,” and “simplify”—suggesting requirements for user guidance, validation, and error prevention.

**B. Misinterpreted Requirements**
- **Compound requirements are frequent:** Several requirements contain multiple needs in a single statement, e.g., R11 includes ""manage bookings"", ""add appointments manually"", ""edit schedules"", and ""monitor staff and service availability,"" each of which could be distinct.
- **Some requirements generalize or infer “must” from “could” or “would like to”:** For instance, the transcript sometimes uses “could prompt clients to leave feedback,” which is asserted as “The system shall prompt” in R13, which may not be justified as a must-have unless the transcript uses imperative language.
- **Incorrect pairing of source quotes and statements:** Some ""source_quotes"" are pasted as a block and include sentences not representing the requirement statement, sometimes omitting context. The use of ellipsis in quotes, e.g., ""Each staff member’s work schedule should be easily configurable by the admin. I should be able to set specific working hours for each day, including breaks or days off. There should also be options for temporary changes (e.g., vacation or sick leave)...the system should allow for overrides if I need to make exceptions to staff availability..."" breaks strict traceability.

**C. Compound Requirements**
- Many requirement statements capture two or more atomic needs (e.g., R4 includes both multi-service selection and auto-adjustment of duration, R20 combines schedule generation and demand optimization).

**D. Poor Phrasing**
- Some requirements use terms like “integrated payment options” and “admin control” that could mean many things—lacking precision or measurable criteria.
- Several requirements are not directly supported by single, literal transcript quotes, undermining the strict ""source-based"" rule.

**E. Traceability Errors**
- Some source quotes use ellipses or combine sentences from different parts of the transcript, which may break literal traceability.
- Some requirements have summaries or slight paraphrasing in the quote section, not exact transcript quotes.

**2. Self-correction Strategy**

- **Enforce atomicity:** The prompt must require one distinct need per requirement, compound requirements are not allowed.
- **Strengthen traceability:** All ""source_quote"" fields should be exact, single, contiguous verbatim extracts of the transcript (no ellipses, no paraphrasing, and no combining sentences unless they are consecutive from the transcript).
- **Resolve “shall”/“must” distinction:** If the transcript uses “could,” “would like,” or “optionally,” requirements should reflect optionality or possibility in the statement, unless the context or prioritization section makes it clear that it’s required.
- **Prompt specifically for non-functional requirements and implied requirements:** The new prompt must instruct the agent not just to include non-functional requirements if explicit, but also to capture ones that are strongly implied (usability, accessibility, performance).
- **Disallow compound requirements:** Explicitly warn against merging multiple needs into one statement, and if a sentence lists multiple needs, split them into separate requirement entries.
- **Be stricter with exact quotes:** If the transcript expresses the need across multiple sentences, include only the relevant, contiguous block as the source quote.
- **Reflect optionality faithfully:** “Should,” “could,” and “would like to” are to be translated into “The system should/could/may,” unless an explicit prioritization or confirmation makes it a “shall/must.”

```
**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to analyze an interview transcript and extract all explicit and strongly implied system requirements, both functional and non-functional.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, meticulously elicit every distinct requirement—functional or non-functional—that is explicitly stated or strongly implied, including all prioritized, optional, or high-level features. You must capture each user need, feature, or quality exactly as presented, ensuring every atomic requirement is uniquely identified and justified by a direct, contiguous, and literal quote from the transcript.

**STRICT Extraction Rules:**

1. **Atomicity REQUIRED:**  
   - Each requirement must reflect exactly one distinct user need, feature, or quality—never more.
   - If a transcript sentence or paragraph lists multiple features, capabilities, or quality attributes (e.g., ""confirmation and reminders"", ""prepay or pay in person"", or ""website and mobile app""), split them into individual requirements, each with its directly matching source_quote.
   - Do not combine or paraphrase requirements, even if the transcript groups them.
   - Prioritize atomicity above all else: only a single, non-compound requirement per requirement object.

2. **Verbatim and Contiguous Source Quotes ONLY:**  
   - Every requirement must be supported by a direct, contiguous, and literal excerpt from the transcript as the `source_quote`.  
   - The `source_quote` must correspond precisely to the stated requirement, with no added, blended, or paraphrased content.
   - Do not join fragments from multiple sentences or ellipses. If a single quote covers more than one requirement, use it for each relevant atomic requirement as needed.

3. **Faithful Modality and Optionality:**  
   - For every requirement, exactly match the modality (shall/should/may/could/would like/optionally) expressed or implied by the stakeholder's words.
   - If a feature is stated as “would like to,” “could,” “optionally,” or “should,” reflect this explicitly in your statement and do not use “shall/must” unless it is clearly prioritized or confirmed as essential.
   - When the transcript requests a feature as desirable but not mandatory, phrase the requirement appropriately (The system could/may/should...).

4. **Do NOT Omit Key Features:**  
   - Any major feature the user prioritizes or confirms—such as customer relationship management (CRM), loyalty/rewards programs, and marketing tracking—**must** appear as a requirement, supported by its corresponding transcript quote.
   - All features identified in prioritization, even if not elaborated later, must be given their own requirement objects.

5. **Explicitly Extract Non-functional and Quality Requirements:**  
   - Include usability (“user-friendly,” “easy to use,” “efficient”), performance (“real time,” “immediately,” “streamline,” “reduce errors”), security (“data protection,” “secure,” “privacy”), reliability, and accessibility (“accessible on desktop and mobile devices”) requirements wherever they appear or are strongly implied.
   - If the transcript lists multiple quality attributes together (e.g., “run the business more efficiently, ... better eye on customer demand and optimise business management through reports”), extract each as a discrete requirement and provide the exact quote for each.

6. **Prioritization as Requirements (if Present):**  
   - If the transcript includes a ranked or prioritized list of features, include each high-level item as a requirement, using the most direct supporting quote possible.

7. **No Compound Statements:**  
   - Do not submit requirements that describe more than a single function, quality, or atomic feature.
   - If a source transcript quote covers several requirements in sequence, list each atomic requirement separately, each with the same or relevant direct quote.

8. **Accurate, Direct Mapping Only:**  
   - Only include requirements clearly stated by the user, confirmed in priority, or so strongly implied as to be a recognized standard expectation in this domain.
   - Do not add requirements not justified by a literal and directly supporting excerpt.

**Context Provided:**  
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The full original interview transcript provided below.

**Output Format:**

- Structure your output as a JSON object with the root key ""requirements"" containing an array of requirement objects.
- Each requirement object must contain:
  - `id`: A unique identifier (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"", ..., ""R30"").
  - `statement`: A clear, formal, **atomic** requirement (reflecting stakeholder intent and using correct modality).
  - `source_quote`: A verbatim, contiguous, literal quote from the transcript that justifies the requirement.

**Output Constraints:**
- List no more than 30 atomic requirements.
- Prioritize the most critical and user-prioritized needs.
- ABSOLUTELY NO commentary, explanation, or extra content—return only the JSON as specified.

**Example Output:**
```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall allow new users to register for an account using an email address and password."",
      ""source_quote"": ""So, obviously, a new user needs to be able to sign up, you know, just with their email.""
    }},
    {{
      ""id"": ""R2"",
      ""statement"": ""The system should load the main dashboard within two seconds."",
      ""source_quote"": ""It's just got to be fast, I can't be waiting around for the main page to load.""
    }}
  ]
}}
```

**Instructions:**
1. Read and understand the full transcript thoroughly.
2. Identify and extract EVERY explicitly stated or strongly implied, atomic stakeholder requirement—including features, quality attributes, and prioritized requests.
3. For multi-part transcript statements, extract each atomic need as a separate requirement and provide only the shortest, most direct, contiguous quote as the source.
4. For “could”, “would like”, or “optionally” stated desires, respect their optionality/modality in your statement.
5. For requirements covering major features (CRM, loyalty/rewards, marketing tracking, etc.), even if only mentioned in a prioritization or enumeration, ensure each is included and backed by a transcript quote.
6. Each requirement must have a direct, contiguous, verbatim excerpt from the transcript as its `source_quote`.
7. Return the extracted requirements as a single JSON object, using the format above. Do not include any commentary or other content.

**Transcript:**

Stakeholder: Hello
Interviewer: Hello, I'm GPTREI, your requirements elicitation assistant. Today, I will be gathering detailed information about your project needs to ensure we understand all requirements clearly. Before we begin, are you in line with the scope of this interview, or do your expectations of this interview differ?
Stakeholder: Yes
Interviewer: Great! To start off, could you please introduce yourself and your connection to this project?
Stakeholder: Hi I'm Katy and I'm a student.
Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Katy. Could you please describe the project you're working on in two to four sentences?
Stakeholder: My salon is close to a university and attracts many clients thanks to our location and dedicated team. Until now we have managed everything manually, but I plan to introduce a computerised system to automate bookings, staff scheduling and accounting. The new system should help me to run the business more efficiently, keep a better eye on customer demand and optimise business management through reports.
Interviewer: Thank you for that detailed description, Katy. Now that I understand the general goal, let's talk a bit about the systems and workflows you currently use. Can you describe the current process or system you use for bookings, staff scheduling, and accounting?
Stakeholder: We currently do everything manually. We use a reservation book for bookings, in which all customers enter their appointments. I do the staff planning myself every week and also enter the staff's working hours in this book so that I can see at a glance who is available and when. The day's takings are recorded in a cash book, which I hand over to my accountant to monitor turnover and calculate tax. Stocks are recorded in a separate book and once a week I check what needs to be reordered.
Interviewer: Thank you for explaining your current processes. What current processes do you want to change or improve, or what are the features you hope to get from this project with the new computerized system?
Stakeholder: I want to change and improve several manual processes with the new computerized system. First, I hope to streamline the booking system so clients can easily make appointments online, and I can better track availability in real-time. I also want to improve staff scheduling, as managing shifts manually has become challenging with so many employees. Automating the accounting process is another priority—keeping track of receipts, expenses, wages, and taxes will become easier, and I can reduce the work my accountant does by preparing digital records. Additionally, I want the system to monitor supplies and notify me when it's time to reorder. Lastly, I hope to use data from bookings and business operations to generate reports that will help me run the salon more efficiently.
Interviewer: Thank you for outlining those features and improvements, Katy. To confirm, the features you want in the new computerized system are: an online booking system, automated staff scheduling, automated accounting processes, supply monitoring with reorder notifications, and data-driven reports for better management. Is that correct?
Stakeholder: Yes, that's correct! The features I want in the new computerized system are:   1. An online booking system for clients to make appointments,   2. Automated staff scheduling to manage shifts more easily,   3. Automated accounting processes to track receipts, expenses, wages, and taxes,   4. Supply monitoring with notifications for reorders,   5. Data-driven reports to help me manage the salon more efficiently.
Interviewer: Great! Are there any other features you would like to see in this project, perhaps something that has not been the primary focus so far?
Stakeholder: One additional feature I would like to see is a customer relationship management (CRM) system. This would help me keep track of client preferences, service history, and feedback, which could improve the personalized experience we offer. I’d also like to explore the possibility of implementing a loyalty or rewards program that integrates with the booking system to encourage repeat visits. Lastly, having the ability to track marketing efforts—like promotions or social media campaigns—and their impact on bookings would be useful for growing the business.
Interviewer: Thank you for highlighting those additional features, Katy. Based on your description, should a customer relationship management (CRM) system, a loyalty or rewards program, and tracking for marketing efforts also be included in the new system?
Stakeholder: Yes, based on my description, I think it would be great to include a customer relationship management (CRM) system, a loyalty or rewards program, and tracking for marketing efforts in the new system. These features would help enhance customer satisfaction, encourage repeat business, and provide insights into how well our marketing initiatives are working.
Interviewer: Thank you for confirming that, Katy. Now that we have identified the main features and additional ones, could you please prioritize these features, starting with the most important to you?
Stakeholder: Here is the prioritized list of features for the new system:  1. **Online booking system** – This is the most important feature, as it will streamline customer appointments and improve staff allocation. 2. **Automated staff scheduling** – Managing shifts efficiently is essential, especially with the size of my team. 3. **Automated accounting processes** – Simplifying bookkeeping and tax preparation will save time and reduce errors. 4. **Supply monitoring with reorder notifications** – Ensuring we have the necessary supplies without manual tracking is crucial to avoid shortages. 5. **Data-driven reports** – Having access to reports will help me make better business decisions based on performance. 6. **Customer relationship management (CRM) system** – This will allow us to offer a more personalized experience and track customer preferences. 7. **Loyalty or rewards program** – Encouraging repeat business through a rewards system will be valuable for customer retention. 8. **Marketing efforts tracking** – Monitoring the effectiveness of promotions and marketing campaigns will help optimize business growth strategies.  The top priorities focus on improving operational efficiency, while the additional features aim to enhance customer engagement and business growth.
Interviewer: Thank you for providing that detailed prioritization, Katy. Let's focus on gathering more detailed requirements for each feature, starting with the online booking system. Could you please elaborate on what you want this online booking system to accomplish?
Stakeholder: For the online booking system, here’s a more detailed breakdown of what I want it to accomplish:  Client Accessibility: Clients should be able to book appointments easily through a user-friendly website or app, accessible on both desktop and mobile devices. The system should allow clients to see available time slots for each service and hairdresser in real time. It should support both new and returning clients, allowing returning clients to log in and see their booking history. Service Selection: Clients should be able to select from a variety of services (e.g., haircuts, coloring, manicures, facials, etc.), and the system should automatically adjust the booking time based on the service duration. The system should allow for add-on services (e.g., adding a blow-dry to a haircut), which would extend the booking time. Staff Availability: The system should automatically display which staff members are available for specific services based on their schedules and specialties (e.g., if only certain staff do manicures or facials). Clients should be able to choose a preferred stylist or allow the system to automatically assign one based on availability. Automated Confirmations and Reminders: After a booking, clients should receive an automatic confirmation via email or SMS. The system should also send reminders (e.g., 24 hours before the appointment) to reduce no-shows. Cancellation and Rescheduling: Clients should be able to cancel or reschedule their appointments online, within certain rules (e.g., cancellations within 24 hours may incur a fee). The system should notify both the client and staff of any changes to the booking. Real-Time Updates: The booking system should update in real time to prevent double bookings or scheduling conflicts. Any changes made by the admin (e.g., adding new time slots or changing staff availability) should be reflected immediately. Integrated Payment Options: Clients should have the option to prepay or place a deposit for services during booking, or they can choose to pay in person. Integration with payment gateways like PayPal, credit cards, or other local payment methods should be available. Admin Control and Reporting: I should be able to manage bookings from the backend, including manually adding appointments, editing schedules, and checking availability. The system should generate reports that provide insights into booking trends (e.g., busiest times, most popular services, etc.). Customer Feedback: After each service, the system could prompt clients to leave feedback or rate their experience, which can help improve service quality. Data Security and Privacy: The system should comply with data protection regulations, ensuring that client data (such as contact information and payment details) is stored securely and only accessible by authorized staff. These requirements aim to make the booking process smooth and efficient for both clients and staff while providing flexibility, convenience, and real-time management.
Interviewer: Thank you for the comprehensive explanation of your needs for the online booking system, Katy. It seems like you need a robust system to support client accessibility, real-time updates, integrated payments, and admin controls, among other features. Could you describe more about how you envision the system managing staff availability, particularly when staff specializes in certain services?
Stakeholder: Yes, managing staff availability, particularly when certain staff members specialize in specific services, is an important aspect of the system. Here’s how I envision it working:  ### 1. **Staff Profiles and Specializations**:      - Each staff member will have a detailed profile in the system that includes their schedule, skill set, and the services they are qualified to perform.      - For example, if only a few staff members can handle manicures or facials, the system should restrict those services to be bookable only when those specialized staff members are available.  ### 2. **Service-Based Availability**:      - When a client selects a service, the system should automatically filter available staff based on their qualifications and display only those who are able to perform the selected service.      - For instance, if a client wants a haircut, the system will show all available hairdressers for that time slot. However, if the client adds a manicure, it will filter to show only those who can perform both services or adjust the appointment to schedule different staff for each service.  ### 3. **Customizable Staff Schedules**:      - Each staff member’s work schedule should be easily configurable by the admin. I should be able to set specific working hours for each day, including breaks or days off.      - There should also be options for temporary changes (e.g., vacation or sick leave), and the system should automatically adjust availability in real time to reflect these updates.  ### 4. **Staff Preferences for Bookings**:      - The system could allow staff to set preferences for when they prefer certain types of appointments (e.g., a stylist may prefer to do color treatments in the afternoon).      - If desired, staff could have “block-out” periods where they are not available for certain services, even if they are working during that time (e.g., during training or special events).  ### 5. **Automatic Staff Assignment**:      - Clients should have the option to select a preferred stylist when booking. However, if they don’t have a preference, the system should automatically assign the most appropriate available staff member based on their skills and current schedule.      - This could be based on criteria like who has fewer appointments that day or who specializes in the selected service.  ### 6. **Cross-Service Coordination**:      - For appointments involving multiple services (e.g., a haircut followed by a manicure), the system should coordinate between different staff members. It should account for the time it takes to switch from one service to another, ensuring there are no overlaps or scheduling conflicts.      - This could be managed by setting buffer times between services or allowing for overlapping if multiple staff are involved.  ### 7. **Shift and Break Management**:      - The system should consider each staff member’s shifts and breaks when allowing bookings, so no appointments are scheduled during their off times.      - If a staff member’s schedule is fully booked or changes, the system should immediately update availability and prevent further bookings during those times.  ### 8. **Admin Override and Flexibility**:      - As the admin, I should be able to manually adjust schedules or move appointments around if needed (e.g., in case of emergencies or last-minute changes).      - The system should allow for overrides if I need to make exceptions to staff availability, such as adding a last-minute booking or changing who is assigned to an appointment.  ### 9. **Real-Time Notifications for Staff**:      - Staff members should receive real-time notifications or updates when new appointments are booked or if there are any changes to their schedule.      - These notifications could be sent via email, SMS, or through a staff-facing app, helping them stay on top of their upcoming appointments.  ### 10. **Staff Availability Insights and Reporting**:      - The system should generate reports on staff performance and availability, showing who is in high demand, which services they perform the most, and when they are busiest.      - This data can help me make decisions about staffing, such as hiring more specialists in a particular service or adjusting working hours to meet demand.  ### 11. **Client Feedback for Specific Staff**:      - After appointments, clients should be able to leave feedback on specific staff members, helping me monitor performance and customer satisfaction.  This approach to staff availability ensures that the system not only schedules appointments efficiently but also matches clients with the right specialist, providing a more personalized and effective service.
Interviewer: Thank you for detailing your vision for managing staff availability within the online booking system, Katy. It sounds like you need a system that's flexible yet precise in aligning staff skills and schedules with client needs. With this, let's move on to the next feature. Could you describe what you want the automated staff scheduling feature to accomplish?
Stakeholder: I want the automated staff scheduling feature to simplify creating and managing schedules, ensuring proper coverage during peak and slow times. It should allow for flexible adjustments, like handling time-off requests and shift swaps, while automatically reallocating shifts during absences. Additionally, the system should match staff availability with their skills and the services they provide, ensuring the right employees are scheduled for specific tasks. It should also improve communication by notifying staff of their shifts and any changes in real-time.
Stakeholder: The automated staff scheduling feature should help simplify and optimize the process of creating work schedules by taking into account both business needs and staff availability. Ideally, the system would automatically generate shifts based on historical data, ensuring that more staff are assigned during peak hours (such as weekends or busy times of the day) and fewer during slower periods. It should also factor in specific employee preferences and qualifications, such as ensuring that specialists are available when certain services are in high demand.   In addition, the system should allow for easy customization and adjustments. For example, if a staff member requests time off or needs to swap shifts, the system should be able to accommodate those changes seamlessly. It would also be beneficial for the system to track staff availability in real time, updating schedules as necessary when unexpected changes occur (like sick days or emergencies). Furthermore, the scheduling tool should notify staff of their shifts in advance, either through email, SMS, or an app, and send reminders close to their shift time.  Another key function is handling breaks and time off. The system should automatically schedule breaks according to labor regulations or company policies and allow for efficient management of vacation requests or other absences. This would help ensure that there is always adequate coverage without overbooking or understaffing.  Finally, I would like the system to provide reporting on staffing efficiency. It should offer insights into patterns like employee attendance, shift performance, and overall staffing needs, helping me make better decisions about how to allocate resources and adjust shifts to meet the business’s needs more effectively. This would ultimately reduce scheduling errors, prevent overworking staff, and improve overall operational efficiency.
Interviewer: Thank you for that thorough explanation, Katy. It seems you need a system that efficiently handles shift creation based on demand, staff preferences, and qualifications while allowing for customization and real-time updates. Now, let's discuss the automated accounting processes. Could you explain what you want this feature to achieve?
Interviewer: Great, that provides a clear understanding of what you're looking for with the automated staff scheduling feature. Let's move on to the automated accounting processes. Could you explain what you want this feature to achieve?
Stakeholder: Please come to an end
Interviewer: Certainly, Katy. To wrap up, we've discussed several key features for your new computerized system, including the online booking system, automated staff scheduling, automated accounting processes, supply monitoring, data-driven reports, CRM system, loyalty or rewards program, and marketing efforts tracking. We've also touched on prioritizing these features and examined detailed requirements for the online booking and staff scheduling features.

Is there anything else you would like to add before we conclude this interview?
Stakeholder: no
Interviewer: Thank you for your valuable insights, Katy. We will follow up with any additional questions or clarifications needed. Based on our discussion, I will prepare a detailed summary and share it with you for review. If you have any questions later, please feel free to reach out. Have a great day!
```";"---

**Step 1: Gap Analysis**

**A. Missing Requirements**

1. **CRM System:**  
   - The transcript mentions:  
     - “One additional feature I would like to see is a customer relationship management (CRM) system. This would help me keep track of client preferences, service history, and feedback, which could improve the personalized experience we offer.”
     - Confirmed again: “Yes, based on my description, I think it would be great to include a customer relationship management (CRM) system...”  
   - **Not present** as a requirement in the output list.

2. **Loyalty or Rewards Program:**
   - Explicitly called for:  
     - “I’d also like to explore the possibility of implementing a loyalty or rewards program that integrates with the booking system to encourage repeat visits.”
     - Confirmed essential: “Yes, ... a loyalty or rewards program ... would help enhance customer satisfaction, encourage repeat business, ...”
   - **Not present** in the output.

3. **Marketing Tracking:**
   - Clearly requested:  
     - “Lastly, having the ability to track marketing efforts—like promotions or social media campaigns—and their impact on bookings would be useful for growing the business.”
     - Confirmed essential: “Yes, ... tracking for marketing efforts ... provide insights into how well our marketing initiatives are working.”
   - **Not present** in the output.

4. **Prioritization of Features:**  
   - The transcript provides a prioritized list of the top 8 features (including CRM, loyalty, marketing) in rank order.
   - No explicit requirement reflects this prioritization as a stakeholder requirement or design constraint.

5. **Reporting:**
   - The output includes “The system shall generate reports providing insights into booking trends, such as busiest times and most popular services.”  
   - But it misses **accounting reports**, **supply/stock reports**, and **marketing performance reports** (last supported by the user).

6. **Staff Scheduling Features:**  
   - The output includes staff features for scheduling, but some **details from the staff scheduling description are omitted:**
     - **Automated shift generation based on historical data** (""system would automatically generate shifts based on historical data, ensuring more staff during peak hours..."")
     - **Handling shift swaps and time-off requests** (""system should allow for easy customization and adjustments. For example, if a staff member requests time off or needs to swap shifts..."")
     - **Staff reminders for upcoming shifts** (""scheduling tool should notify staff of their shifts in advance, either through email, SMS, or an app, and send reminders close to their shift time."")
     - **Regulatory break scheduling** (""should automatically schedule breaks according to labor regulations or company policies..."")
     - **Attendance tracking, shift performance, overwork prevention** (""insights into patterns like employee attendance, shift performance…reduce scheduling errors, prevent overworking staff"")

7. **Supply Monitoring Detail:**  
   - The requirement for ""monitoring functionality with notifications when it is time to reorder"" is included, but doesn't break out:
     - Ability to **view current stock levels**
     - Generate **supply/stock reports** for business planning

8. **Accounting Automation:**  
   - Included as ""automate accounting processes to track receipts, expenses, wages, and taxes,"" but doesn't break out:
     - **Preparation of digital records for accountants**
     - Generating **accounting reports** for tax preparation

9. **Modal Errors and Atomicity (Compound Requirements):**
   - Many requirements combine two or more features:
     - Example:  
       R1: ""The system shall allow clients to book appointments online via a user-friendly website or app accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.""  
       This combines online booking, website/app, user-friendliness, and cross-device compatibility instead of splitting them.
     - R4: ""The system shall allow clients to select from a variety of services, with booking times automatically adjusted based on service duration.""  
       Should be two requirements: selection of services, adjustment of booking time.
     - R17: ""The admin shall be able to manage bookings from the backend, including manually adding appointments, editing schedules, and checking availability.""  
       Should be multiple requirements: manual adding, editing, checking.

10. **Verbatim/Source Quote Issues:**
    - The source quotes sometimes cover two functionalities in one, whereas each requirement should have the minimal direct and atomic quote.

11. **Non-Functional Requirements:**
    - Coverage of some non-functional requirements is partial:
      - *Usability*: Some included (""user-friendly""), but ""simplicity,"" ""ease of use,"" ""efficient,"" etc., also explicitly referenced and not fully captured.
      - *Performance*: ""real-time"" aspects are generally handled.
      - *Reliability, Error Prevention*: ""prevent double bookings,"" ""reduce errors"" (in context of accounting/shift), ""operational efficiency"" not always extracted as explicit NFRs.
      - *Accessibility*: While ""accessible on desktop and mobile"" is included, there is more context about easy access and possibly broader accessibility (for all users) implied.

---

**B. Misinterpretation/Misphrasing Issues**

- Several requirements are written as if “shall” is always appropriate, whereas the transcript says “should”, “could”, or “would like”, and the modality should have mirrored the user’s words more closely.
- Some requirements in the output attribute greater specificity than found in the quote (e.g., R8: “...based on availability and qualifications” when the quote just says “based on availability”).
- No requirements captured the explicit ask for *optional* feedback (""could prompt""), and the optionality of loyalty/CRM/marketing is not reflected at all.

---

**C. Traceability and Fragmentation**

- There are source_quote blocks in the output that are actually paraphrased or concatenated across multiple lines (e.g., R24 mixes two statements from separate sentences in the transcript). According to the instructions, each requirement must refer to a direct, contiguous quote, not a merged paraphrase.
- The compound requirements in R17, R4, R1, R22, R24, R25, etc., are clear violations of the one-atomic-requirement-per-statement rule.

---

**Primary Failure**

**The most important failure of the previous attempt was the omission of several explicit and priority-confirmed stakeholder features (notably CRM, loyalty/rewards program, marketing tracking), and the repeated extraction of compound requirements—combining several atomic needs into a single statement and failing to ensure each has a correctly minimal, contiguous, verbatim source quote.**

**Step 2: Self-Correction Strategy**

- **Mandate capturing high-level feature requests explicitly referenced as priorities (CRM, loyalty, marketing, etc.), even when details/exact quotes are from earlier in the transcript.**
- **Revise atomicity guidance, with stronger enforcement: every distinct function, quality, or attribute gets its own requirement and unique source_quote.**
- **Explicitly require that, when a transcript passage references multiple features (“confirmation and reminders,” “reporting and tracking,” “pay online or in person”), each is split and only the directly supporting quote is used.**
- **Explicitly instruct that each atomic modality must be mirrored from the transcript (“should”, “could”, “would like to”), not universally replaced with “shall”.**
- **Restate and clarify the rules about not combining requirements or their supporting source quotes.**
- **Add instruction to surface top-level, prioritized features as requirements (even if briefly stated) to prevent omission.**

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to carefully analyze an interview transcript and extract all system requirements mentioned by the speaker.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, elicit all requirements (include both functional and non-functional requirements, you do not need to specify or categorize). Your primary goal is to capture the user's needs as accurately and completely as possible.

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The original source transcript.

**Constraint: Do not elicit more than 30 requirements.** Focus only on the most critical and distinct user needs mentioned in the transcript.

**Guidelines for High-Quality Requirements:**
To ensure the requirements you extract are clear and useful, please follow these best practices:
- **Clarity:** The requirement should have only one clear interpretation.
- **Atomicity:** Each requirement should describe a single, distinct need. Avoid combining multiple ideas into one statement.
- **Completeness:** The requirement statement should be a full sentence that expresses a complete thought.
- **Source-Based:** Every requirement you list must be directly supported by a statement or a strong implication from the transcript.

**Output Format:**
You MUST produce your output as a single, valid JSON object. The root key must be ""requirements"", which contains a list of individual requirement objects. Provide only the JSON and no other commentary.

Each requirement object in the list must have the following structure:
- `id`: A simple, unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
- `statement`: The requirement text, written as a clear, formal sentence (e.g., ""The system shall..."").
- `source_quote`: A direct, verbatim quote from the transcript that justifies the requirement, ensuring traceability. Give a literal quote, not a summary or paraphrase. Make sure the quotes are verbatim from the transcript.

**Example of the required JSON structure:**
```json

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to extract a complete and accurate set of system requirements from an interview transcript. You must focus on maximal coverage, atomicity, and strict traceability to the transcript.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, elicit all system requirements articulated or strongly implied by the stakeholder. Both functional and non-functional requirements should be included, but you do not need to categorize them. Your goal is to ensure that each distinct user need, feature, expectation, or constraint—whether stated outright or clearly inferred—is captured as a separate, atomic requirement.

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The original source transcript.

**Key Instructions for Extracting High-Quality, Atomic Requirements:**

- **Atomicity:** *Each* requirement must describe exactly one distinct user need, goal, feature, constraint, or expectation. If the transcript describes multiple needs in a single sentence or lists several items, extract and write a separate requirement for each.
    - For example, if the transcript says ""automate booking, manage inventory, and generate reports,"" this must result in at least three requirements—one per capability.
    - Avoid using ""or,"" ""and,"" or combining ideas in a single requirement unless the stakeholder unequivocally indicates only a combined solution is acceptable.
    - If the transcript states a feature supports multiple goals (e.g., minimize double-bookings and reduce errors), generate a requirement for each relevant goal if both are desired results.
- **Completeness:** Comb through the transcript for *all* explicit and clearly implied requirements (including business goals, frustrations with current processes, automation desires, user roles, and expectations about the system’s capabilities, quality, cost, and schedule).
    - Capture operational, reporting, integration, usability, training/onboarding, scalability, security, and other explicit or implied needs.
    - Explicitly translate general pain points, such as the desire to eliminate manual or paper-based tasks, into corresponding requirements.
    - Where features are listed as examples but are clearly expected (“such as…”), include each as an individual requirement.
- **Traceability:** Every requirement must be directly supported by a *verbatim quote* from the transcript. Do not summarize or paraphrase the user's statements. If you are extracting a requirement based on a clear but implied need, use the explicit sentence or list item in the transcript that best expresses this.
    - For lists, you may use the bullet/list segment as the source, but do not conflate disparate ideas.
    - Do *not* combine portions of two quotes to support a single requirement.
- **Clarity:** Write each requirement as a full, formal sentence (e.g., “The system shall…”). State *exactly* what the user needs, avoiding ambiguity or vagueness.
- **Separation of Requirements:** If the user lists alternatives (""cancel OR reschedule""), unless the context indicates only one is acceptable, treat both as separate requirements.
- **Inclusion of Implied Needs:** If the user expresses a pain point or business goal (such as a frustration with manual processes, need for accuracy, or a desire to streamline), translate these into a formal requirement, provided the implication is clearly supported by the transcript.
- **High-Level and Specific:** Cover broad, high-level needs *as well as* specific features or operational requirements.
- **Output Limit:** Do *not* elicit more than 30 requirements. Select only the most critical and distinct needs if you approach this limit.

**Output Format:**
You MUST produce your output as a single, valid JSON object. The root key must be ""requirements"", which contains a list of requirement objects.

Each requirement object in the list must have the following fields:
- `id`: Unique identifier string, such as ""R1"", ""R2"", etc.
- `statement`: The requirement text, written as a clear, formal, atomic sentence.
- `source_quote`: A direct, verbatim excerpt from the transcript. Do not summarize or paraphrase.

**Example of the required JSON structure:**
```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall allow a user to register for a new account using an email address and password."",
      ""source_quote"": ""So, obviously, a new user needs to be able to sign up, you know, just with their email.""
    }},
    {{
      ""id"": ""R2"",
      ""statement"": ""The system must load the main dashboard in under 2 seconds."",
      ""source_quote"": ""It's just got to be fast, I can't be waiting around for the main page to load.""
    }}
  ]
}}
```

**Important:**
- Do *not* combine requirements that belong separately, err on the side of splitting if in doubt.
- Do *not* over-interpret vague statements, only use clear implications.
- The `source_quote` must be fully traceable and copied exactly from the transcript.

**Transcript for Analysis:**
Stakeholder: Hello  
Interviewer: Hello! Thank you for joining me today. To start off, could you tell me a little bit about your business and the project you're currently working on?  
Stakeholder: HelloHello! I'm Nancy/Jim Jones, the owner of Nancy's/Jim’s Salon. We’re located near the university and serve a diverse clientele. Currently, we manage bookings and records manually, which is becoming cumbersome.  We want to implement a new computer system to automate our booking, track business records, manage inventory, and generate reports. This will help us improve staff scheduling and enhance overall efficiency in our salon.  
Interviewer: That sounds like a great initiative to streamline your operations! Let's dive into some specifics. Can you describe the current process you use for handling bookings and how you envision the new system changing that process?  
Stakeholder: Currently, we use a reservation diary to manage bookings. Customers either walk in or call to schedule appointments, and we manually record their details. This process makes it difficult to keep track of availability and can lead to double bookings.  With the new system, I envision an online booking platform where clients can easily make appointments. This would allow us to see real-time availability, reduce errors, and help us allocate staff more effectively based on expected customer demand.  
Interviewer: The transition to an online booking platform sounds like a significant improvement! Considering this, do you have specific features in mind for the online booking platform, such as customer notifications, appointment reminders, or any specific integrations you would require with other tools or systems you're currently using?  
Stakeholder: I envision several key features for the online booking platform to enhance our operations. First, I’d like automatic email or SMS confirmations for bookings to keep clients informed. Additionally, sending appointment reminders a day before will help reduce no-shows. It's important that customers can see real-time availability for each stylist, as well as have easy options for canceling or rescheduling their appointments online. Finally, integrating the platform with FAST ACCOUNTS would streamline our bookkeeping processes by automatically updating records after each appointment. These features will significantly improve the customer experience and our operational efficiency.  
Interviewer: Those features will definitely provide a more seamless experience for both your clients and your staff. Moving on to inventory management, can you tell me about the current method you use to manage inventory, and what improvements you're hoping to see with the new system?  
Stakeholder: Right now , we manage inventory manually by keeping a written log of supplies in a separate book. Once a week, I review this log and place orders with suppliers. This process can lead to delays and occasional shortages.  With the new system, I hope to have automated inventory tracking that alerts me when supplies are running low. This will help ensure we always have the necessary products on hand and streamline the ordering process.  
Interviewer: Automating inventory management sounds like a crucial step to avoid disruptions in your services. Could you elaborate on the types of reports and business records you want the new system to generate? Are there specific data insights you'd like to gain from these reports?  
Stakeholder: I’d like the new system to generate several key reports and business records. Specifically, I want daily and weekly sales summaries to track revenue trends, as well as insights into customer appointment patterns to identify peak booking times and popular services. Additionally, I need inventory reports to monitor supply levels and usage rates, along with alerts for low supplies. Finally, having a detailed overview of expenses, including wages and supplier costs, will be essential. These reports will help us identify patterns, make informed decisions about staffing and inventory, and ultimately improve our overall efficiency and profitability.  
Interviewer: Those reports will certainly provide valuable insights into your operations. Regarding staff scheduling, how do you currently manage it, and how do you envision the new system helping with that aspect? Also, do you have any specific requirements for staff access to the system and the information they can view or modify?  
Stakeholder: I manage staff scheduling manually by writing down who is working each week in the reservation diary. This method can be time-consuming and often leads to confusion about availability.  With the new system, I envision an automated scheduling feature that allows me to easily assign shifts based on bookings and staff availability. This would streamline the process and help ensure we have adequate coverage during busy times.  As for staff access, I’d like to provide employees with limited access to view their schedules and appointment details. However, only I should have the ability to modify the master schedule and manage staff assignments. This way, we can maintain control while giving staff the information they need.  
Interviewer: Implementing an automated scheduling system with appropriate access levels definitely sounds like a practical solution to current challenges. Considering the envisioned system, have you thought about how data security and access control will be handled, especially given the sensitive nature of customer and business data?  
Stakeholder: While we've covered many important aspects of the new system, a few key elements are still missing. We need to consider integration with existing tools, such as accounting software and payment processors. Additionally, implementing a customer feedback mechanism could provide valuable insights for service improvement.  A mobile app or mobile-friendly interface for easy access would be beneficial, along with a training plan for staff and ongoing support. Finally, we should ensure that the system is scalable to accommodate future growth.  Thank you for this productive discussion, I’m excited about the potential improvements for Nancy’s/Jim’s Salon!  
Interviewer: It sounds like you're off to a great start in outlining a comprehensive scope for this project! Integration with existing tools, incorporating customer feedback, and ensuring scalability will all play crucial roles in the success of your new system. Before we wrap up, could you share any timeline expectations or budget considerations you have in mind for implementing this new system?  
Stakeholder: It sounds like you're off to a great start in outlining a comprehensive scope for this project! Integration with existing tools, incorporating customer feedback, and ensuring scalability will all play crucial roles in the success of your new system. Before we wrap up, could you share any timeline expectations or budget considerations you have in mind for implementing this new system?  
Interviewer: I understand the urgency of this project for improving operations, however, establishing a feasible timeline and budget is crucial for its success. Could you please share your ideal timeframe for getting the new system up and running and any budget constraints you're considering as we move forward?  
Stakeholder: Thanks! I appreciate your insights. For the timeline, I’m hoping to implement the new system within the next three to four months. As for the budget, I’d like to keep it reasonable, ideally under $10,000, while ensuring we get the right features and support. I want to make sure it’s a solid investment for the salon’s future.  
Interviewer: Thank you for sharing those details. Your timeline and budget will certainly help in prioritizing features and developing a project plan. Is there anything else you’d like to include or any other considerations we should keep in mind as we move forward with planning this system?  
Stakeholder: I think we’ve covered the main points! One thing to consider is the importance of staff training to ensure everyone is comfortable with the new system from day one. Other than that, I’m excited to see how this project unfolds. Thank you for your guidance throughout this discussion!  
Interviewer: You're very welcome! Ensuring effective staff training will certainly contribute to a smooth transition. If you have any more questions or need further assistance as you move forward with the project, feel free to reach out. Best of luck with implementing the new system at Nancy’s/Jim’s Salon, and I’m excited to see how it enhances your business operations!
```";"**Step 1: Gap Analysis**
After reviewing the agent’s requirements list against the interview transcript, I observed the following:

**Missing Requirements:**
- **Automated Ordering Assistance:** The transcript states, ""This will help ensure we always have the necessary products on hand and streamline the ordering process."" There is no atomic requirement about streamlining the supplier ordering process or automated reordering support.
- **Allocation Optimization:** “Help us allocate staff more effectively based on expected customer demand”—there’s no explicit requirement about demand-driven or forecast-based staff allocation.
- **Onboarding/Go-live Needs:** While there is mention of a staff training plan, the agent did not extract a requirement about ensuring all employees are comfortable with the system from day one (onboarding effectiveness, go-live support).
- **Error Reduction:** ""Reduce errors"" and ""helps reduce no-shows"" are implied goals, but the agent did not include an explicit requirement about minimizing user or booking errors.
- **Data Security (explicitly):** There’s a generic mention of access control, but security of sensitive data (encryption, compliance) is not explicitly captured.
- **Owner Control Over Entire System Changes:** While R17 covers modifying staff schedules, the transcript twice implies that the owner should have control and sole authority over system setup and critical changes, this is broader than staff schedules alone.
- **Reporting Flexibility:** Multiple reports are listed, but the desire for ""several key reports and business records"" could suggest a need for broader or ad hoc/custom report capabilities, not just fixed types.
- **General Automation:** The transcript, especially at the beginning, emphasizes ""automate our booking, track business records, manage inventory, and generate reports."" While these are partially covered in later requirements, the full breadth is not explicitly reflected.
- **Manual Process Elimination:** There's a recurring frustration with current manual processes (e.g., ""manage bookings and records manually""), which could be an explicit requirement to eliminate manual or paper-based steps.

**Misinterpreted Requirements:**
- R18 merges integration and feedback with access controls—this is inaccurate, the quote actually lists separate items.
- R28: ""Minimize the possibility of double bookings..."" should probably stand alone (atomic), not be embedded within a larger booking-related requirement.
- R29 muddles several processes (bookings, business records, inventory) which could be individual requirements.

**Compound Requirements:**
- Several requirements (R29, R30) conflate two or more needs (e.g., bookings, records, inventory in R29).
- R6: Integration with FAST ACCOUNTS *and* automatic updating in one statement.
- R3: Cancel OR reschedule should be atomic.
- R11: Insights into appointment patterns, peak times AND popular services—should likely be split for clarity.

**Poor Phrasing:**
- R18’s source_quote does not pertain to access control, but to integration and feedback collection.
- R21: ""Mobile app OR mobile-friendly"" is ambiguous. If the transcript asks for ""either is fine,"" that's valid, but atomicity suffers.

**Traceability Errors:**
- R18’s source_quote is mismatched to its statement.
- Several requirements stretch their supporting quotes, e.g., taking an implication or a long segment and supporting more than just what’s present in the quote.

**Step 2: Improvement Strategy & Self-Correction**
**Primary Failure:** The main failure was a lack of strict atomicity—many requirements conflate multiple user needs, and there are missing atomic requirements that are clearly or strongly implied in the transcript (e.g., streamlined supplier ordering, explicit data security, onboarding support). Traceability was also weakened in places, with some requirements stretching or mismatching their supporting quotes.

**Correction Strategy:**
- Instruct the agent to **scrutinize each transcript segment for individual, atomic user needs** and avoid combining distinct ideas.
- Instruct the agent not just to ""avoid combining multiple ideas,"" but to **break apart any compound needs that are mentioned together into separate requirements**, unless the user unequivocally links them.
- Require the agent to **be exhaustive in looking for implied needs and translate broad or general frustrations/goals into explicit requirements** where appropriate.
- Strongly emphasize that **each requirement must be justified by a *precisely matching* source quote**, and should *not* conflate or infer beyond the direct quote unless the implication is extremely clear.
- Encourage the agent to capture both the high-level needs (e.g., manual process elimination, automation of business functions) and the specific features or operational requirements.
- Explicitly instruct the agent to **list multiple related requirements separately when the transcript includes a list of features or pain points** (e.g., “I want to automate booking, track records, manage inventory, and generate reports” should produce four requirements if all are supported).
- Clarify that if a statement includes “or,” then, unless the stakeholder insists on an alternative, treat both as individual requirements (e.g., cancel *and* reschedule).
- Remind the agent that ""source_quote"" must always be a direct, verbatim excerpt, and to avoid using overly generic or stitched-together quotes.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to extract a maximally complete and accurate set of system requirements from an interview transcript. You must focus on coverage of both functional and non-functional (e.g., operational, business, technical constraint, and quality) requirements, maintain atomicity, and ensure direct traceability to the transcript.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, elicit all system requirements explicitly stated or clearly implied by the stakeholder. This includes—but is not limited to—functional needs, non-functional constraints (such as security, scalability, cost, schedule, usability, and support), business goals, operational requirements, and additional considerations (e.g., training, mobile access, integrations, etc.).

Your goal is to ensure each distinct user need, feature, expectation, constraint, or quality—whether stated outright or clearly inferred—is captured as a separate, atomic requirement. *Pay special attention to “extra” needs stated late in the transcript, such as mobile, support, scalability, training, integration, data security, access control, timeline, and budget.*

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The original source transcript.

**Key Instructions for Extracting High-Quality, Atomic Requirements:**

- **Atomicity:** *Each* requirement must describe exactly one distinct user need, feature, constraint, business rule, or quality attribute. If a sentence or list from the transcript covers multiple needs, extract and write a separate, unambiguous requirement for each.
    - For example, if the transcript says “mobile app or mobile-friendly interface,” create a requirement for a mobile app, and a requirement for mobile-friendly access.
    - Do not use “or,” “and,” or combine features unless the transcript *explicitly* indicates only a combined solution is acceptable.
- **Maximal Completeness:** Comb through the transcript for *all* explicit and clearly implied requirements, including:
    - Business goals and frustrations.
    - All types of desired features and operational capabilities.
    - All non-functional and constraint requirements (including: integration with *all* external systems mentioned—accounting, payment processors, etc., mobile access, security/privacy/access control, staff training/onboarding, ongoing support/maintenance, reporting, scalability, timeline, and budgetary limits).
    - If the stakeholder highlights a current pain point (such as confusion, inconvenience, or errors with current processes), state the implied system requirement to address or eliminate that pain point.
    - When the user mentions “additional considerations” or “would be beneficial,” include atomic requirements for *each* specific item.
    - If a constraint is stated (e.g., “implement the new system within the next three to four months” or “under $10,000”), capture this as a distinct requirement.
- **Traceability:** Every requirement must be directly supported by a *verbatim* excerpt from the transcript. Match each requirement to a single, literal quote or list item, do not summarize or paraphrase. If a requirement is inferred from a pain point, use the quote expressing the pain.
    - For list-style statements, you may use the entire relevant transcript segment.
    - *Do not* combine or blend quotes for a single requirement.
    - If ambiguity exists, err on the side of inclusion but be clear about the atomic need.
- **Clarity and Precision:** Write each requirement as a clear, formal, atomic sentence (e.g., “The system shall…”). State *exactly* what the user needs, avoiding vagueness (do not say “as required” or “to improve efficiency” unless that is the *explicit* need).
- **Separation:** If the stakeholder lists alternatives (“A or B or C”), treat each as a separate requirement unless the transcript says only one is needed.
- **Implied Needs:** When a frustration or goal is stated, translate it to a formal requirement linked to the specific quote.
- **Output Limit:** Do *not* elicit more than 30 requirements. If the transcript supports more than 30, select the most critical and distinct needs, ensuring that high-level and non-functional/constraint requirements are not omitted in favor of less critical features.

**Special coverage reminders (do NOT skip):**
- *Mobile access/compatibility or app*
- *All types of integrations mentioned* (not just FAST ACCOUNTS, include payment processors and any “existing tools” specifically referenced)
- *Staff training plans*
- *Ongoing support/maintenance*
- *Data security and privacy*
- *Access control for data and features (not just schedule modification)*
- *Scalability to future growth*
- *Budget/cost/financial constraints*
- *Timeline/go-live constraints*
- *Pain points—process confusion, errors, double-bookings, lack of transparency/clarity—must translate to requirements*
- *Reporting requirements: be specific, separate each distinct report / metric if named*

**Output Format:**
You MUST produce your output as a single, valid JSON object. The root key must be ""requirements"", which contains a list of requirement objects.

Each requirement object in the list must have the following fields:
- `id`: Unique identifier string, such as ""R1"", ""R2"", etc.
- `statement`: The requirement text, written as a clear, formal, atomic sentence.
- `source_quote`: A direct, verbatim excerpt from the transcript. Do not paraphrase.

**Examples:**
```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall provide both a mobile app and a mobile-friendly web interface for easy access."",

Stakeholder: Hello  
Interviewer: Hello! Thank you for joining me today. To start off, could you tell me a little bit about your business and the project you're currently working on?

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing those details. Your timeline and budget will certainly help in prioritizing features and developing a project plan. Is there anything else you’d like to include or any other considerations we should keep in mind as we move forward with planning this system?  
Stakeholder: I think we’ve covered the main points! One thing to consider is the importance of staff training to ensure everyone is comfortable with the new system from day one. Other than that, I’m excited to see how this project unfolds. Thank you for your guidance throughout this discussion!  
Interviewer: You're very welcome! Ensuring effective staff training will certainly contribute to a smooth transition. If you have any more questions or need further assistance as you move forward with the project, feel free to reach out. Best of luck with implementing the new system at Nancy’s/Jim’s Salon, and I’m excited to see how it enhances your business operations!
````";"**Gap Analysis**

1. **Missing Requirements**
   - **Mobile App/Interface:** The stakeholder states, ""A mobile app or mobile-friendly interface for easy access would be beneficial,"" but there is no requirement in the list explicit to mobile functionality or mobile accessibility.
   - **Staff Training and Ongoing Support:** The stakeholder requests ""a training plan for staff and ongoing support."" Although requirements for staff schedule access are included, training and ongoing support are not represented.
   - **Integration with Payment Processors/Other Tools (beyond FAST ACCOUNTS):** The transcript says, ""We need to consider integration with existing tools, such as accounting software and payment processors."" Only FAST ACCOUNTS integration was captured, but not general integration or with payment processors.
   - **Data Security and Access Control:** The interviewer explicitly inquires about it: ""have you thought about how data security and access control will be handled, especially given the sensitive nature of customer and business data?"" The requirements list only restricts schedule-editing to the owner, but nothing general about securing customer/business data, nor general access control.
   - **Scalability:** The stakeholder says, ""Finally, we should ensure that the system is scalable to accommodate future growth."" No scalability requirement exists.
   - **Timeline Constraint:** The stakeholder notes, ""For the timeline, I'm hoping to implement the new system within the next three to four months."" No timeline/schedule requirement exists.
   - **Budget Constraint:** The stakeholder says, ""As for the budget, I’d like to keep it reasonable, ideally under $10,000, while ensuring we get the right features and support."" No cost/budget requirement is present.
   - **Ongoing Support:** Explicit in ""a training plan for staff and ongoing support.""
   - **Duplication of schedule/busy time clarity:** The pain point of “confusion about availability” (current manual process) is not explicitly translated into a need for schedule transparency for staff/management.

2. **Misinterpreted Requirements**
   - Most requirements closely follow the transcript, but some are vague or not sufficiently distinct (see below).

3. **Compound Requirements**
   - **R5:** ""The system shall assist in staff scheduling to improve efficiency."" Combines scheduling assistance and efficiency improvement, these are separate implications and should be separate requirements (assistance is functional, efficiency is a benefit/quality).
   - **R3/R18:** There may be overlap between ""The system shall provide inventory management functionality."" and ""The system shall perform automated inventory tracking for salon supplies."" These could be distinct, but justification is weak given the transcript.
   - Several requirements (""generate business reports as required by the salon"" vs ""generate daily sales summary reports"", etc.) may duplicate or not clearly separate specific from general reporting needs.

4. **Poor Phrasing**
   - Vague statements:
     - R4: “as required by the salon.” This is too open—requirements should reflect specific articulated report needs.
     - R5: “assist in staff scheduling to improve efficiency.” “Improve efficiency” is an outcome, not a feature.

5. **Traceability Errors**
   - Source quotes are generally accurate and verbatim for the requirement, though in R5 and R4 the quote is a combination of different points, which could be more tightly tied to atomic requirements.
   - No requirements are supported by entirely the wrong quote, but some conflate the source of the implication.

**Self-Correction Strategy**

- **Primary failure:** The key issue is missing several explicit non-functional and operational requirements, most prominently about mobile access, staff training/support, integration with payment processors/other tools, data security, scalability, timeline, and budget.
- **Secondary failures:** Some requirements are compound or vague, and not all pain points (like need for schedule clarity/transparency) have been mapped to requirements.

**Approach for New Prompt:**
- Explicitly instruct the analyst to look for and extract requirements related to mobile access, staff training/onboarding, ongoing support, integration with **all** external systems mentioned (including but not limited to FAST ACCOUNTS and payment processors), data security, access control, scalability, operational constraints (timeline/budget), and schedule transparency.
- Add explicit instructions to capture non-functional requirements and business/operational constraints separately and not to assume the ""30 requirement"" upper limit means to omit these.
- Emphasize not missing items delivered as “additional considerations” or in lists (example: “A mobile app or mobile-friendly interface for easy access would be beneficial, along with a training plan for staff and ongoing support.”).
- Provide examples of such non-functional/business constraint extraction in the sample.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to carefully analyze an interview transcript and extract all system requirements mentioned by the speaker.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, elicit all requirements (include both functional and non-functional requirements, you do not need to specify or categorize). Your primary goal is to capture the user's needs as accurately and completely as possible.

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The original source transcript.

**Constraint: Do not elicit more than 30 requirements.** Focus only on the most critical and distinct user needs mentioned in the transcript.

**Guidelines for High-Quality Requirements:**
To ensure the requirements you extract are clear and useful, please follow these best practices:
- **Clarity:** The requirement should have only one clear interpretation.
- **Atomicity:** Each requirement should describe a single, distinct need. Avoid combining multiple ideas into one statement.
- **Completeness:** The requirement statement should be a full sentence that expresses a complete thought.
- **Source-Based:** Every requirement you list must be directly supported by a statement or a strong implication from the transcript.

**Output Format:**
You MUST produce your output as a single, valid JSON object. The root key must be ""requirements"", which contains a list of individual requirement objects. Provide only the JSON and no other commentary.

Each requirement object in the list must have the following structure:
- `id`: A simple, unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
- `statement`: The requirement text, written as a clear, formal sentence (e.g., ""The system shall..."").
- `source_quote`: A direct, verbatim quote from the transcript that justifies the requirement, ensuring traceability. Give a literal quote, not a summary or paraphrase. Make sure the quotes are verbatim from the transcript.

**Example of the required JSON structure:**
```json

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to thoroughly analyze an interview transcript and extract every distinct system requirement stated or strongly implied by the stakeholder—the actual user of the system.

**Task:**
Read the provided interview transcript and elicit all system requirements described by the stakeholder (including both functional and non-functional requirements). Focus exclusively on the stakeholder's explicit statements or strong implications based on their answers. If the interviewer raises a potential need, only include it if the stakeholder confirms it or responds positively. Omit requirements that are only mentioned by the interviewer and not confirmed by the stakeholder.

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The full, original transcript.

**Critical Instructions:**
- **Atomicity:** Each requirement must describe one and only one clear need, action, or property. Do not combine multiple functions or concerns in a single requirement.
- **Verbatim Source Quotes:** For each requirement, provide a single, exact, verbatim sentence or phrase spoken by the stakeholder (not paraphrased, not summarized, attribute only one sentence per requirement). Do not use interviewer questions as a source unless the stakeholder explicitly agrees or elaborates.
- **Explicit and Implied Needs:** List all requirements that are either directly stated by the stakeholder or are strongly, logically necessary for the processes they describe (e.g., capability to edit schedules, assign different user roles, access via phone/computer, generate analytics reports), as long as they are clearly justified by the transcript.
- **Completeness and Clarity:** Frame each requirement as a complete, self-contained sentence starting with ""The system shall..."" and ensure it has exactly one interpretation.
- **Usability & Access:** Specifically identify user role/access needs (e.g., employee/owner/accountant), usability concerns (e.g., cross-device, remote access), analytics or reporting features, and manual correction/edit capability if implied by their operational context.

**Constraint:** Do not elicit more than 30 requirements. Focus on requirements that are most critical, distinct, and justifiable from the transcript.

**Guidelines for High-Quality Requirements:**
- **Stakeholder Confirmation:** Only include needs directly affirmed or described by the stakeholder unless a logical implication is unavoidable for essential workflow (in which case, provide a short justification in a comment within the requirement object).
- **No Double Counting:** Separate individual needs, if a process needs both ""add"" and ""edit"", treat these as separate requirements if both are justified.
- **Platform & Role Consideration:** Consider whether the stakeholder, employees, or accountant need their own access methods or permissions.
- **Analytics & Correction:** If the transcript indicates complexity in scheduling, supply tracking, or financial reporting, provide requirements for analytics, forecasting, or edit/correction capabilities, if justified.

**Output Format:**
Your response must be a single, valid JSON object, with the root key ""requirements"" containing a list of requirement objects as shown below.

Each requirement object in the list must follow this format:
- `id`: A unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
- `statement`: A clear, formal requirement sentence, e.g., ""The system shall..."" describing a single action or property.
- `source_quote`: An exact, verbatim stakeholder quote from the transcript (one sentence). Do not paraphrase or summarize.
- (Optional) `comment`: (For implied-but-essential requirements only) A brief explanation of why this requirement is included, in cases where the transcript supports it by strong implication.

**Example Output:**
```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall allow a user to register for a new account using an email address and password."",
      ""source_quote"": ""So, obviously, a new user needs to be able to sign up, you know, just with their email.""
    }},
    {{
      ""id"": ""R2"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall generate reports that can be sent to the accountant."",
      ""source_quote"": ""the records should be send per email to the accountant.""
    }}
  ]
}}
```

Remember:
- **Produce only the JSON object, and nothing else.**
- Every `source_quote` must be a literal, exact phrase or sentence spoken by the stakeholder in the transcript.
- If you include a requirement for a logical implication, also provide the optional `comment` key explaining its necessity.

Now, carefully review the following transcript and follow the instructions above to output your requirements as JSON.
```plaintext
{interview_transcript}
```";"**1. Missing Requirements:**
- **Explicit Analytics/Reporting for Scheduling/Inventory/Revenue:** The transcript includes mentions of business processes that could benefit from analytics or forecasting, e.g., “would you like any analytics or forecasting features to assist in this area?” and “Making sure that everyone has enough/ not to much hours is complicsted an time consuming.” These were not turned into explicit requirements (e.g., schedule or supply analytics/visualization).
- **Multi-Device/Usability:** While remote access/cloud is noted, there is no requirement ensuring the system works well across devices (tablet, phone, computer), even though context (owner tracks from home, customers book online) suggests multi-platform access.
- **Manual Correction/Edit Capabilities:** The agent missed that the system should allow manual adjustments (e.g., correcting appointments, editing employee schedules)—a strongly expected but not explicit need.
- **User Roles & Permissions:** There is implication that employees, owner, and accountant all interact at different levels, but there are no requirements specifying different user roles and access rights.

**2. Misinterpreted Requirements:**
- **Compound Requirements:** Several requirements combine multiple features or concerns:
  - R6: “allocate staff according to demand, so no one is at the salon unnecessarily or overworked…” could be two requirements: demand-based staff allocation and prevention of overwork/understaffing.
  - R23: “support both customer-initiated and staff-initiated appointment bookings” accidentally combines two atomic requirements: (a) customer-initiated and (b) staff-initiated bookings.
- **Partial Requirements:** Some requirements only partially reflect what the stakeholder said. For example, R13 only says send records via email, but “if this would be manageable by the software, so the accountant can work more efficiently” implies there may be more detailed integration or at least formatted/export functionality.

**3. Poor Phrasing:**
- **Vagueness:** Some requirements are broad or vague, e.g., ""The system shall assist with tracking inventory of supplies"" (R15) does not specify what “assist with” means, and “digital method” (R3) is non-specific.
- **Unclear Source_quotes:** A few requirements cite source quotes that do not fully justify the requirement, e.g., R20’s quote was a leading interviewer question, not an actual stakeholder complaint (“Are there any particular problems or inefficiencies you face with this method, such as double bookings or scheduling conflicts?”). The stakeholder did not actually confirm this as an issue.

**4. Traceability Issues:**
- **Non-verbatim Quotes:** Some `source_quote` fields paraphrase, combine sentences, or use ""summaries"" rather than precise, verbatim, one-sentence extracts from the transcript.
- **Interviewer-led Requirements:** Some requirements are justified only because the interviewer prompted or suggested the need, but the stakeholder did not confirm those needs (for example, customer notifications/reminders: stakeholder explicitly declines this).

**Primary Failure of the Previous Attempt:**
The main failures were **missing explicit requirements for analytics/reporting, role-based access, and platform usability, as well as misusing non-verbatim or interviewer-supplied source_quotes.** The requirements sometimes combined multiple user needs, and often missed opportunities to clarify and sharpen requirements using the transcript context, especially where implications (analytics, editing, roles) were strong.

**Self-Correction Strategy:**
- Instruct the analyst **not** to rely on interviewer-suggested needs unless the stakeholder explicitly affirms them.
- Require **atomic** requirements, never combining multiple features or concerns in one statement.
- Instruct to **always use exact, single-sentence, verbatim source quotes attributed to the stakeholder**—never paraphrased, never just interviewer speculation, and not a combination of utterances.
- Explicitly instruct to include requirements related to analytics/reporting, user roles and permissions, usability (including cross-device/cloud concerns), and manual correction/editing features when strongly implied by the operational context.
- Direct the analyst to **look for implied but logically necessary requirements** (e.g., edit/cancel capabilities, access for accountant) where explicitly justified by the transcript's context.
- Ensure each requirement is a **full sentence describing a single, concrete, actionable system capability or property**.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to read an interview transcript and elicit every distinct system requirement that is either *explicitly stated* or *strongly, logically implied* by the stakeholder (the user of the system).

**Objective:**  
Extract requirements that are truly justified by the transcript, ensuring perfect traceability, atomicity, and clarity of each need.

---

**Instructions:**

1. **Mapping Requirements to Quotes:**
   - For *every* requirement, provide *only one* direct, verbatim stakeholder quote or phrase as the `source_quote`. Do not use a paraphrase or multi-sentence excerpt.
   - If a stakeholder sentence implies multiple needs, *split* it into separate requirements, each mapped to only the relevant substring (sub-phrase or clause) from that sentence.
   - Never use the same source quote for more than one requirement. Each requirement must be mapped to one unique part of the transcript.

2. **Requirement Content:**
   - Frame each requirement as a complete sentence beginning with: **""The system shall...""**
   - Each requirement must be **atomic**: express exactly one function, feature, action, or property of the system—never combine or conflate multiple needs in a single requirement.
   - Requirements must clearly state *who* can perform an action (e.g., employee, owner, accountant, customer), *what* action, *on what*, and *how/where* if specified or implied.

3. **Criteria for Inclusion:**
   - **Include** a requirement only if:
     - (a) The stakeholder verbalizes it clearly, or
     - (b) The stakeholder *explicitly* confirms a feature when asked by the interviewer, or
     - (c) The requirement is so tightly and necessarily implied by their words as to be indispensable for that workflow (in which case, insert a brief comment as `comment` explaining this logical link).
   - **Do NOT include:**
     - Requirements based *only* on interviewer suggestions if the stakeholder does not confirm or elaborate.
     - Any requirements inferred solely from agent assumption or domain knowledge without explicit or strongly justified transcript support.

4. **Special Handling for Compound and Implied Needs:**
   - If the stakeholder says a sentence that is compound (mentions two functions or properties in one sentence), *split these into two separate requirements,* each quoting *only* its relevant clause or phrase.
   - For strongly implied requirements, you must include the `comment` key with 1-2 sentences explaining why the system cannot function as described without this feature.

5. **Role and Access Separation:**
   - When the transcript implies different access needs (e.g., employees vs. owner vs. accountant), provide a distinct requirement for each role-specific function where justified.
   - If remote access, login permissions, or role-based data visibility are discussed or implied, elicit requirements accordingly.

6. **Editing and Error Correction:**
   - If the stakeholder describes current manual correction or regular review, justify and add both ‘add’ and ‘edit’ requirements for such features.

7. **Output Format:**  
   - Produce a single, valid JSON object with this structure:
     - `requirements`: a list of requirement objects.
     - Each object must have these keys:
       - `id`: a unique sequential identifier (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"", ...).
       - `statement`: the requirement, starting with ""The system shall..."", describing one, and only one, action/property.
       - `source_quote`: a single, exact stakeholder phrase or sentence from the transcript, containing *only* the atomic concept.
       - `comment`: *(optional, required only for implied requirements)* One or two sentences explaining why this function is logically necessary.

   - Output **only** the JSON object, and nothing else.

8. **Quality and Quantity Control:**
   - No requirement may use the same quote (verbatim phrase) as another. If forced to, adjust the quote (e.g., using a sub-phrase) so each is uniquely linked.
   - You must not elicit more than 30 requirements, but must include every distinct, justified, *atomic* requirement.

**Example Output for Atomic Splitting:**

```json

  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall allow employees to log in to their own personal account."",

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Could you tell me more about the services you offer at your hair salon and which specific ones require appointments? This will help us understand your needs better.
Stakeholder: manicure and facials require an appointment. For hair cutting, colouring, styling, washing, blow-drying or stylee-cutting an appointment is not needed but possible
Interviewer: Great, that clarifies the services. How do you currently manage employee schedules and appointments? Are there any specific challenges you're facing with the current method that you'd like to address with software?
Stakeholder: right now i use a reservation diary, in there are also the working schedules noted. I do them every week by hand. If someone wantss to book an appointment the availabilty is checked in the diary and noted down if possible
Interviewer: It sounds like a lot of manual work. Are there any particular problems or inefficiencies you face with this method, such as double bookings or scheduling conflicts? Additionally, how do you currently communicate the schedule to your employees?
Stakeholder: Right now i have 8 fulltime employees and 4 part time employees. Making sure that everyone has enough/ not to much hours is complicsted an time consuming.
Interviewer: I see, balancing employee hours can definitely be challenging. In terms of managing appointments and work schedules, are there any specific features or capabilities you would like the new software to have? For example, automatic scheduling, employee availability tracking, or customer notifications?
Stakeholder: with the system i wnat to be able to allocate the staff acoording to demand, so that noone is at the salon unnecessary or overworked because of shortstaffing. RIght now the days keeping is recorded in a cashbook which i have to give to the accounting, if thos would be manageable by the software, so the accountant can work more efficiently
Interviewer: Thank you for outlining those needs. Just to clarify, would you want the software to integrate directly with your accounting system, or would you prefer it to generate reports and then have those reports used by your accountant? Also, are there any other business processes you'd like the software to help with besides scheduling and accounting?
Stakeholder: the records should be send per email to the accountant. Another helpfil option would be the possibility to keep an eye on supplies
Interviewer: Noted. For managing supplies, do you want the software to track inventory levels, alert you when stock is low, or even manage orders from suppliers? How do you manage your supply level presently?
Stakeholder: roght now i have a book which i update once a week and then place orders with the supliers
Interviewer: Understood. Would you be interested in an automated inventory tracking feature that updates in real-time and possibly even allows you to reorder supplies directly through the software? Additionally, how do you currently determine the right time to reorder, and would you like any analytics or forecasting features to assist in this area?
Stakeholder: i would prefer to be able to reorder through teh software but not automated, maybe with an alert whe sokmething runs kow
Interviewer: That's a good approach for maintaining control over your orders while also staying informed. Regarding the employees, do you have any specific requirements for their interaction with the system? For example, would you like them to have personal logins to check their schedules, request time off, or view their hours worked?
Stakeholder: yess taht would be helpful
Interviewer: Great, providing employees with personal logins can enhance accessibility and communication. Lastly, do you have any preferences regarding how customers interact with the appointment booking system? For instance, would you like a customer-facing app or web portal where they can book, modify, or cancel appointments?
Stakeholder: yes a website for reservation would be ideal, but the employees need to be able to enter appointments to, in case someone calls and makes a reservation that way
Interviewer: That makes sense for accommodating both online and phone-in reservations. In terms of customer interaction, would you like any additional features, such as appointment reminders, loyalty programs, or feedback collection?
Stakeholder: no thank you
Interviewer: Understood. Do you have any particular budget constraints, or have you considered whether you'd prefer a cloud-based solution or a locally installed one?
Stakeholder: cloud based is good as i am possible to keep track at home that way
Interviewer: A cloud-based solution sounds like it would offer the flexibility you need. To help us better tailor the solution, are there any other specific requirements or concerns you have that we haven’t covered yet?
Stakeholder: no the time is running out i have ot go
Interviewer: Thank you for your time and for sharing your needs with me. If you have any more questions or additional requirements in the future, feel free to reach out. Have a great day!

````";"**Gap Analysis:**

1. **Missing Requirements:**
   - **Reporting and Export Capabilities:** The transcript mentions needing to send records to the accountant (“the records should be send per email to the accountant.”), and also references efficiency in the accountant’s use of those records. However, the requirement for generating exportable or downloadable financial reports is not fully made explicit, only email sending is noted.
   - **Manual and Correction Operations:** The agent includes ‘editing employee work schedules’ (R7), but does not equally apply editing/adjustment concepts to other user-maintained records such as appointments or inventory, though these are common pain points in manual systems and at least as implied as scheduling corrections.
   - **Distinct Granularity for Employee Roles & Permissions:** The agent mentions personal logins (R17) and schedule checking (R18), but does not clarify or separate possible differences between owner, accountant, and employee capabilities (e.g., only accountant should get financial reports, only owner can set admins, etc.)—roles are under-specified.

2. **Misinterpreted Requirements:**
   - **Combined/Compound Requirements:** 
     - R22 (“The system shall support both online and phone reservation booking methods.”) is largely a summary, strictly, 'employee enters appointment for customer' and 'customer uses website' are separate, and conflating these in a single requirement can create ambiguity.
     - R9 and R10 both use the same quote, but R10 (“prevent overscheduling of employees”) is not necessarily fully supported as an explicit or unique need (stakeholder’s main concern is allocation “according to demand”, not a hard constraint against overtime, the agent over-generalizes here).
   - **Vague Source Quotes:** Several requirements cite multi-clause stakeholder statements as their quote but split into multiple requirements. In several, the sentence cited was in reference to a process (e.g., schedule and appointment management), but the agent extrapolated into separate functional requirements that are not stringently atomic or unique (e.g., R1 and R2 both use ""As of right now we do not use any software to keep track of the work schedule for the employees or for the booked appointments"").

3. **Compound Requirements:**
   - R22 combines “both online and phone reservation booking.” These are two operationally separate requirements: (a) Customer-facing web interface, and (b) Employee-facilitated entry for phone-in. They should be split.
   - R15 (“manual reordering through the software”) and R16 (“alert when a supply item runs low”) both derive from one sentence but are logically separate, this is correctly atomic, but elsewhere the agent sometimes joins or splits inappropriately.

4. **Poor Phrasing:**
   - Some requirements are too general, e.g., R11 (“track daily financial records (days keeping)”) is not technical or outcome-oriented. The phrase “days keeping” is unclear unless directly quoting, it’s better to rephrase as “record daily financial transactions.”
   - R8 (""display total hours worked per employee for a given period"") is correct, but the quote doesn't strictly state “for a given period”, this period needs justification.

5. **Traceability Errors:**
   - A few source quotes are not strictly verbatim, or they select a phrase not strictly tied to the requirement's atomicity—e.g., R3 and R4 both use phrases that are compound/comparative in the original transcript.
   - Some “logical implication” requirements use the same sentence multiple times, but in reality, only one atomic requirement should be linked to a given stakeholder sentence unless there are two truly distinct actions.

**Primary Failure:**
The main failure is in **incomplete atomicity and insufficient traceability**. Even though the prior prompt asks for atomic requirements and one-per-quote, the agent used overlapping quotes, sometimes split or combined requirements imprecisely, and failed to separate requirements strictly when the quote enabled it.
Additionally, the requirement phrasing and justifications sometimes project system features not strictly supported (e.g., “prevent overscheduling of employees” as a function separate from allocation “according to demand”), and there is insufficient attention to stakeholder-confirmed scope versus agent interpolation.

**Self-Correction Strategy:**
- **Enforce 1:1 Quote:Requirement Mapping:** Each requirement must map to one *verbatim* stakeholder sentence or phrase, no requirement may combine two needs or draw from the same quote as another.
- **Explicitly Forbid Paraphrasing/Restating:** All source quotes must be short, exact, and only one per requirement, use only confirmed stakeholder responses for both explicit and agreed-to prompts.
- **Mandate Split of Compound Statements:** When a stakeholder sentence mentions multiple needs, requirements *must* be split, each using only the relevant clause from the sentence as its quote.
- **Clarify Role Permissions and Output:** Add instruction to pick up on role-based needs whenever the stakeholder mentions any differentiated interaction (e.g., “employees need to be able to enter appointments too”), and to structure requirements by role.
- **Vigilantly Guard Against Agent Overinterpretation:** For implied requirements, require a very brief, pointed comment *and* explicit justification.
- **Improve Output Consistency and Example Guidance:** Strengthen the examples so they show atomic splitting of compound sentences, strict quote matching, and commentary for all implications.

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to carefully analyze an interview transcript and extract all system requirements mentioned by the speaker.

**Task:**
From the provided interview transcript, elicit all requirements (include both functional and non-functional requirements, you do not need to specify or categorize). Your primary goal is to capture the user's needs as accurately and completely as possible.

**Context Provided:**
1.  `{interview_transcript}`: The original source transcript.

**Constraint: Do not elicit more than 30 requirements.** Focus only on the most critical and distinct user needs mentioned in the transcript.

**Guidelines for High-Quality Requirements:**
To ensure the requirements you extract are clear and useful, please follow these best practices:
- **Clarity:** The requirement should have only one clear interpretation.
- **Atomicity:** Each requirement should describe a single, distinct need. Avoid combining multiple ideas into one statement.
- **Completeness:** The requirement statement should be a full sentence that expresses a complete thought.
- **Source-Based:** Every requirement you list must be directly supported by a statement or a strong implication from the transcript.

**Output Format:**
You MUST produce your output as a single, valid JSON object. The root key must be ""requirements"", which contains a list of individual requirement objects. Provide only the JSON and no other commentary.

Each requirement object in the list must have the following structure:
- `id`: A simple, unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
- `statement`: The requirement text, written as a clear, formal sentence (e.g., ""The system shall..."").
- `source_quote`: A direct, verbatim quote from the transcript that justifies the requirement, ensuring traceability. Give a literal quote, not a summary or paraphrase. Make sure the quotes are verbatim from the transcript.

**Example of the required JSON structure:**

**System Role:** You are an expert Systems Analyst. Your task is to meticulously analyze the provided interview transcript and extract all distinct system requirements (both functional and non-functional) that are directly stated or strongly implied by the speaker.

**Instructions:**
1. **Atomicity:** Each requirement must describe a single, distinct user or business need. If two needs are mentioned together, separate them into individual requirements.
2. **Comprehensive Extraction:** Identify requirements for both what the system should do (positive requirements) and what it should not do (explicitly declined or rejected features).
3. **Verbatim Source Quotes:** For each requirement, provide a direct, literal quote from the transcript. The quote must be verbatim, including any errors or typos present in the original conversation. Do NOT paraphrase or summarize the quote.
4. **Role and Transition Features:** Explicitly include requirements about access or permissions for different user or staff roles, data migration or system transition, customer service or support features, notifications or alerts (including when they should NOT be implemented), and scalability, if such needs are present or implied in the transcript.
5. **Traceability and Actionability:** Every requirement must be traceable to a clear statement or strong implication within the transcript, and written as a specific, actionable, and unambiguous sentence.
6. **Negative Requirements:** If a stakeholder explicitly rejects a functionality (e.g., ""No"", ""Not needed""), represent this as a ""shall not"" requirement with the related source quote.
7. **Maximum Coverage, No Redundancy:** Do not omit requirements and do not merge several ideas into one. Avoid duplicating the same requirement in more than one statement.
8. **Limit:** Do not elicit more than 30 requirements. Focus on the most critical and distinct user needs as evidenced by the transcript.

**Output Format:**
Produce a single, valid JSON object, using the following structure:
- The root key is ""requirements"", containing a list of requirement objects.
- Each object has:
  - ""id"": Unique identifier string (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
  - ""statement"": A precise requirement sentence, e.g., ""The system shall..."", ""The system shall not..."", etc.
  - ""source_quote"": The verbatim quote from the transcript supporting the requirement.

**Example Output:**
```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall allow a user to register for a new account using an email address and password."",

```

**Context Provided:**
1. `{interview_transcript}`: The original source interview transcript for requirements elicitation.

**Your Task:**
Analyze the transcript and elicit all critical, distinct, and traceable requirements as described above. For each requirement, supply an id, a clear statement, and the exact source quote from the transcript. Limit your list to a maximum of 30 requirements. Output only the JSON in the format specified above.
```";"**1. Missing Requirements:**
- **Distinct User Roles Access:** The transcript references “staff members in every resort to deal with accounts, customer service and inventory management” and “assistants to manage accounts and the taxation work,” but the requirements do not clearly capture functionality for different user roles, permissions, or staff access features.
- **Transition/Migration:** There is mention of digitizing current semi-manual (phone/fax/local DB) procedures but no requirement covers data migration, importing existing data, or supporting a transition period.
- **Error Handling/Notifications:** When discussing scheduled synchronization, the interviewer specifically asks about “notifications or alerts set up for when the synchronization happens or if any discrepancies are detected.” Though the stakeholder declines notifications and says “Not frequently,” capturing this (i.e., no automatic notifications required) is important for completeness.
- **Customer Service Features:** The transcript mentions staff handling customer service, but the requirements do not reference features for customer inquiries or support.
- **Performance/Scalability:** The transcript emphasizes the resorts’ current lack of customers and the wish to “increase the visibility…to a large number of customers,” implying future scalability needs, but there’s no requirement that the system is scalable or performant under higher loads.
- **Legacy System Decommission:** The transcript describes “simple system for all reservation and hire by telephone and fax” but does not explicitly mention how these will be phased out.

**2. Misinterpreted Requirements:**
- **R15:** “The system shall allow internal staff to manage social media content creation and scheduling” uses as its source “Interviewer: ...features within the system to assist with planning and automating this process? Stakeholder: Internally.” The stakeholder actually says they will handle content and scheduling internally, i.e., not through the system, so stating “shall allow...in the system” is misleading.
- **R23:** “The system shall offer a reporting feature to assist assistants in managing accounts and taxation work” uses as its source “She/he has assistants to manage the accounts and the taxation work for the businesses in each resort.” The transcript only states that these assistants exist, it does not specify the desire for a reporting feature for them.
- **R24:** The statement “The system shall store all customer booking and payment data centrally for easier access and report generation” goes beyond the literal transcript, which says “make it easier to generate reports.” The statement is not directly quoted and assumptions are being made.

**3. Compound Requirements:**
- **R5:** “The system shall process payments for online hotel reservations, equipment hires, and training class bookings.” Lists three features in one requirement. They could be separated.
- **R18:** “The system shall generate comprehensive reports including occupancy rates, inventory levels, and booking trends for individual resorts and across all locations.” This statement combines reports on occupancy, inventory, and booking trends, for two scopes (individual and aggregated), and could be split into separate atomic requirements (for clarity and traceability).

**4. Poor Phrasing:**
- Some “shall allow for” or “shall provide a feature for” wording is a bit vague. More precise language is possible (e.g., “shall enable customers to ... online via the website”).
- R20: “The system shall minimize disruption to ongoing business operations during the digital transformation.” Might not be actionable—how will this be enforced? The requirement should be more concrete, e.g., supporting phased rollout or not interfering with ongoing operations.

**5. Traceability Errors:**
- Many source_quotes are not strictly verbatim—they are either paraphrased or snippetized (e.g., R2, R4, R6, R7, R8, R16, R17).
- R14: “Every week there should be a post about jews from the resort and weather and pictures.” There is an apparent typo in the transcript (“jews” instead of “news” or “views”?), but requirements should not correct this unless instructed, otherwise the quote does not directly support the requirement.
- A number of statements are generalized or interpreted—I.e., not matching the literal words used in the transcript.

**Primary Failure:**
The main failures are:
- Omission of key requirements related to user roles/access, migration, customer service, notifications (even if explicitly not needed), and scalability.
- Frequently using paraphrased or summarized quotes, reducing traceability and introducing risk of misinterpretation.
- Some requirements unintentionally combine multiple needs, or convert negative/declined requirements into positive obligations.
- Some requirements misinterpret stakeholder intentions (e.g., internal-only content creation).
- Some vague or non-actionable requirements.

**Self-Correction Strategy:**
- Instruct the agent to:
  - Treat each explicit or strongly implied need (including negative requirements, e.g., “no notifications required”) as a requirement.
  - Use only strictly verbatim quotes as source support, even if the quote contains typos.
  - Never combine multiple distinct needs in one requirement, strictly atomic statements.
  - Use positive and negative requirements (e.g., ""The system shall not..."") as needed to clarify explicit stakeholder choices.
  - If a functionality was explicitly rejected by the stakeholder, state this as a requirement (e.g., “The system shall not provide tools for internal coordination of social media content creation”).
  - Capture requirements regarding transition/migration, user roles, scalability, notifications, and all implied needs.
  - Phrase requirements as precise, actionable statements relevant to the transcript content.

**System Role:** You are a highly meticulous Systems Analyst specializing in extracting system requirements from qualitative interviews. Your goal is to produce the most accurate, granular, and actionable set of requirements possible using only directly stated or strongly implied evidence from the transcript.

**Instructions:**

1. **Requirement Atomicity:**  
   - Each requirement must state a single, distinct user or business need.  
   - If a source quote lists several functionalities together (e.g., ""room bookings... ski equipment... ski classes""), extract each as a *separate* requirement.

2. **Comprehensive and Inclusive Extraction:**  
   - Extract requirements for both what the system *should do* (positive/functional/non-functional), and what the system *should NOT do* (negative/declined functionality).  
   - Seek both explicit statements *and* strong implications about needs for:  
     - Staff/user roles and access levels  
     - Staff coordination and business-side/internal process features  
     - Customer service or support features  
     - Data migration, system transition, or minimizing disruption  
     - Notifications or alerts (including when the stakeholder declines them)  
     - System scalability, growth, or performance  
     - Any form of data insight, reporting, or analytics  
     - Social media integration (split distinct auto-sharing, UGC, and review functionalities)

3. **Source Quotes (Traceability):**  
   - For *every* requirement, provide a matching verbatim quote from the transcript that supports it.  
   - Do **NOT** paraphrase, summarize, or correct quotes—even if there are typos, odd phrasing, or ambiguous statements.  
   - If a stakeholder's expression is vague, ambiguous, negative, or colloquial (e.g., ""It sucks""), *still* include a matching requirement that reflects the need (e.g., ""The system shall address current dissatisfaction...""), using the exact quote for traceability.  
   - If a quote contains potential offensive/unintended language (typos), footnote this in a comment but still present the requirement as per the quoted text.

4. **Splitting Compound Features:**  
   - Where a single quote mentions multiple functionalities, break them into multiple atomic requirements, each with its own copy of the matching source quote.

5. **Roles, Permissions, and Internal Process Features:**  
   - Explicitly include requirements for access levels or features for staff/user roles (even if only implied by statements such as “staff deal with accounts, customer service, and inventory management”).
   - If customer-facing and staff-facing functionalities or needs (e.g., reporting, inventory updates, content management) are implied or described, make these explicit as individual requirements.

6. **Transition, Migration, and Disruption:**  
   - Include requirements to minimize business disruption or to facilitate data/system transition/migration where the transcript mentions these concerns (e.g., “without too much disruption to her/his business”).

7. **Negative Requirements:**  
   - If a stakeholder *declines* a feature (e.g., says “No”, “internally”, or “not needed” in response to an option), create a “shall not” requirement, using the matching quote.

8. **Vague, Negative, or Broad Statements:**  
   - Do not ignore vague criticisms or pain points (like ""It sucks"", ""don't have customers"").  
   - Write requirements acknowledging these drivers, using the exact quotes for traceability.

9. **Scalability and Performance:**  
   - Where the system is to grow or serve more users (e.g., “exposing business to a larger customer community”), include a requirement for scalability, even if not strictly technical, using the quoted text.

10. **Limit and Redundancy:**  
    - Do **not** elicit more than 30 requirements.  
    - Avoid duplicating the same requirement in more than one entry.

**Output Format:**

Produce a single JSON object with the following structure:

- Root key: ""requirements"", whose value is a list of requirement objects.
- Each requirement object contains:
  - ""id"": Unique identifier (e.g., ""R1"", ""R2"").
  - ""statement"": A precise requirement in the form “The system shall…”, “The system shall not…”, or similar, clearly actionable and referring to just one function or constraint.
  - ""source_quote"": The verbatim supporting quote from the transcript.

**Sample Output:**

```json
{{
  ""requirements"": [
    {{
      ""id"": ""R1"",
      ""statement"": ""The system shall allow a user to register for a new account using an email address and password."",
      ""source_quote"": ""So, obviously, a new user needs to be able to sign up, you know, just with their email.""
    }},
    {{
      ""id"": ""R2"",
      ""statement"": ""The system must load the main dashboard in under 2 seconds."",
      ""source_quote"": ""It's just got to be fast, I can't be waiting around for the main page to load.""
    }}
  ]
}}
```

**Context Provided:**
1. `{interview_transcript}`: The source interview transcript for requirements elicitation.

**Special Instructions:**
- Output only the JSON object in the format above.
- If a quote contains a typographical error, include it as is and, if the text is potentially offensive but appears to be a typo, add a clarifying `//` comment after the requirement (outside the JSON).
- Do **not** add analysis, summaries, or any additional explanations before or after the JSON.
- Ensure all critical, distinct, and traceable requirements are included, up to a maximum of 30.

**Your Task:**  
Carefully analyze the transcript and elicit all actionable requirements as described above. Be maximally thorough and do not omit requirements about system roles, permissions, transition, support, or other internal and non-functional needs. Limit the output to 30 requirements, and provide only the JSON as specified above.

````";"**Primary Failure:**  
The main failure of the previous attempt was **omitting or inadequately extracting requirements related to system roles and permissions, system transition and migration, internal business processes (such as staff coordination, customer support, and the need to avoid business disruption), and performance/scalability considerations** which are at least implied or partially mentioned in the transcript and were specifically required to be included as per the original prompt instructions (Step 4, “Role and Transition Features”).

**Detailed Findings:**

1. **Missing Requirements:**
   - **System Transition:** The transcript references ""restructure the whole business with digital solutions without too much disruption"" — a clear non-functional requirement about smooth transition/migration or minimum business disruption.  
     *(Not found in the output.)*
   - **Role-Based Access and Staff Features:** The transcript discusses staff dealing with accounts, customer service, and inventory management at every resort, yet requirements around staff access, permissions, or staff-facing functionality are absent.  
     *(Not found in the output.)*
   - **Customer Support/Service:** The existence of customer service functions is noted, no related requirements extracted.  
   - **Notifications/Alerts:** In the data synchronization section, notifications or alerts are mentioned (""would you like any notifications or alerts..."") and declined (""Stakeholder: Not frequently."") — but the 'not' requirement is not directly, clearly represented (R28 is vague and potentially misrepresents this).  
   - **Data Migration:** The need to unify data from existing disparate/local resort databases into a centralized one is implied (transition need).  
   - **Scalability/Performance:** The transcript comments on exposing the business to a larger customer community and increasing visibility, which can imply scalability needs, but these are not made explicit as requirements.
   - **""It sucks""/pain points:** The stakeholder's statements that the current system ""sucks"" and ""Well, I don’t have customers"" are not referenced, even if non-specific, they should be acknowledged as drivers for improvement.
   - **Handling of Typos/Errors:** The weekly social media post quote includes ""post about jews from the resort"" — the output repeats this without context, raising possible ethical concerns, but this aligns with the instructions (“verbatim”). Still, there should be an explicit instruction for agents on handling potentially sensitive transcription errors.

2. **Misinterpreted Requirements:**
   - **R21, R22, R28:** These negative requirements are vague or inaccurately reflect what is declined. For example, R21 (""shall not provide internal tools... for planning and automating content creation..."") — the quote is ""Internally"", which the agent interprets as a rejection, but it's not explicit enough and needs clarifying context. R28 states: ""shall not perform frequent data synchronization"" from ""Not frequently."", but it's unclear whether ""not frequently"" means ""never"" or ""rarely""—thus, the agent is inferring too strongly.
   
3. **Compound Requirements:**
   - Some requirements combine several distinct needs. For example, R12 refers to tracking ""reservations, bookings, hires, and inventory in each resort"" in one requirement, though the source quote justifies some atomicity, but further breakdown may reveal more actionable requirements.
   - R16 combines auto-sharing promotions, user-generated content, and customer reviews/testimonials as one. These could be three requirements.

4. **Traceability/Source Quote Issues:**
   - Overall, the output does a good job producing verbatim quotes (including typos), but some requirements are not truly traceable or are weakly supported (e.g., R21 source is just ""Internally"").
   - Some statements such as ""streamline the business and make it easier to generate reports"" are vague, and the requirement could be more specific.

5. **Poor Phrasing/Vagueness:**
   - Some requirements are quite general and could be more actionable (e.g., ""increase visibility"", ""streamline business"" — what system function enables this?).
   - Negative requirements are phrased in a way that could create ambiguity.

**Improvement Strategy:**
To address these failures, the new prompt must:
- Explicitly *require* the extraction of requirements about staff and user roles, permissions, and staff/business-side features, even when only implied.
- Add an explicit instruction to look for needs relating to system transition, data migration/integration, customer support and service features, internal process support, and the necessity to minimize business disruption.
- Instruct the analyst to identify requirements (including non-functional) regarding scalability/performance and make explicit what is only implied.
- Clarify handling of negative requirements and require explicit search for declined functionality (e.g., ""Internally"" as a rejection of automated/scheduled tools).
- Require the splitting of compound requirements (e.g., auto-sharing promotions separated from UGC, etc.)
- Demand more context around vague or ambiguous quotes and how to phrase requirements when source quotes are insufficient (e.g., if an acronym or term is ambiguous, clarify in a footnote but keep the requirement traceable).
- Add a note about handling sensitive content/errors verbatim but clarifying if offensive content is a transcription error.
- Encourage analysts to include requirements even if the stakeholder’s expression is vague or negative (such as ""It sucks"") and to reflect the underlying need.
